# Earth's movement

The earth is moving at roughtly 390 km/s relative to the Cosmic Background Radiation (CBR). This aws observer and calculated in 1989. The CBR is considered a fixed, absolute, frame of reference ratehr than a relative motion to other celestial bodies.

The direction of movement is roughtly towards the Leo constellation.

The diameter of the earth is roughly 6378 km (at equator using spherical approx).

Therefore, a particle fixed in space will take 16.35 seconds, at most, to cross the from one side of earth to the other via it's diameter.

Leo constellation lies in the northem hemisphere.

# Crater / Young Planetvore

- roughly 66 million years ago
- 11-81 km diameter
- caused the Creatcious-Paleogene boundary: the K-pg boundary. Theory is that it caused 75% of palnt and animal species to die including non-avian dinosaurs.
- exposed and expelled large amounts of granite and quartz, shoked under pressure, from deep below the earth's crust upards, forming a distinctive sedimentary layer signature.

# Gulf of Mexico tectonics

The guld of mexico is a "subduction" zone, where one plate is sliding underneath another. However, it is a very differnt type from any other (for example Japan). There are fewer "earthquakes" but a new tyope of "silent" quake has beew discovered where imperceptible tremors can last months. There is a previously unknown "layer" between the mexico plates that has been called the "Ultra-Slow" layer, reducing some seimic waves by 30%-40%.

# young Planetvore

The young planetvore is growing at roughly 2mm per year (this is the rate of growth of lichen). Given the 66 million years, the planetvore has grown by roughly 132km in diameter. This planetvore is what is causing the strange properties of the tectonics. In fact, the "layer" is actually the black liquid, with the planetvore itself being confused for a tectonic plate (it is encrusted in it). 

The earth volue is roughly 135847661567.86115 km^3.
The young planetvore's current volume is roughly 4988916.154543867.
This means that the planetvore encompases roughtly 3.672434326042271e-05 fraction of the earth.

If the planetvore is actually growing as a radius (quadratic rate than fungi), the get the following:

young planetvores current volume: 21314441.1399649 km^3
palnetvore encompases 0.00015689958070656606 fraction of earth's volume.

Both growth rates represent an object that, if moved or disappeared (or awaken) would be a *MAJOR* factor in whole-each dynamics. May even break the planet completely.

# lichen

- Lichen are *not* plants of fungi or moss. Rather they are algae or cynobacteris living among filaments of fungi species forming a completely new organism. 

- depending on species, the relations can be mutialistic, parasici, or commensalistic.

- We estimate the 6% of the earth's land surface is covered in lichen.

- Lichen are aggressive extremaphiles found in tundras, desserts, toxic heaps and even ricks itself between the grains.

- Lichens are considered some of the oldest living things. Oldest is found in the Artic with approximately 8600 years of life and still going

- some species are known to survive in space (actually tested!)

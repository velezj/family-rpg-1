## Aspect: He Who is InBetween
Half in spirit world and half in physical world, Ghost Owl is one of a kind. His magic extends to the physical world better than a regular spirit, but there are still limittions that make it harder than doing magic strictly in the spirit world. Has is visible and has no problem interacting with physical objects. Attentive people may notice a slight shimmer to his feathers.

As like in the spirit world, Ghost Owl's prowess come from his wisdom and will ratehr than muscle.

## Aspect: Call of the Avatar
The Great Spirits have demanded that an Owl Avatar be found and forged. This makes Ghost Owl shine with "Purpose" in the spirit world. As such his ability to be stealthyt in the spirit world in hon-existant. The purpose also brands his leg with the symbol of the Great Spirits. The avatar of Wisdom, the Owl Avatar, is nothing like the Rat. While the Rat's avatar is found simply by locating the most cunning, the wisdom avatar must be groomed, for wisdom grows with experience. Furthermore, the Wisdom Avatar always has a goal; its is not just wisdom for wisdom's sake, but rather the careful application of jsut the right wisdom for the time.

## Aspect: The Walking Dream
The Great Spirits have asked Ghost Owl to stop the awakening. It is a thing of both Spirit and Physical and hence Ghost Owl is a perfect choice. With the task also comes an atunned ment to sleep and it's many forms. This includes dreams, nightmares, daydreams.

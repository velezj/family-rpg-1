# Events

- found van with sleeping van

- The Estate researching gas since it was highly targeted to quick sleep with no side effects

- Federation + Og arrived

- rules of meeting:
  - Federation is treating as earth jsut talking to one of it's citizens that has done nothing wrong
  - Federation wants all recordings of alejandro and the ability to regulate who the knowledge therein can be shared with.
  - Exception for imminent hard ccan be shared to any earth human (since their a frontier world and who would talk to a human anyway :) )
  - This is starting to be the spark of a channel of communication between erath and the Federation. Sort of like a "back channel" before a true diplomatic conversation can start.
  - Og *must* be accompanied by a federation representative during all talks with Alejandro
  - Sarah Donati taken as representing "the group" (which is taken to be earth for all intense and purposes)
  
  
- one civilian transport and 3 "cruise". Total of ~ 300 soldiers around earth outside solar system.

# General characteristics

# Current Status

## Aspect: Out Of Time
Currently because of the black liquid, Alejandro's time concreteness has faded. Time magic works easier on him, and he often can tell past and future events with meditation. He also has an increased ability to sense the flow of time and can manipulate it slightly with and act of will.

## Aspect: Return of Vorvados
Alenjandro is the original "Vorvadoss" of Lovecraftian design. He befriended Lovecraft and was the origin of many of the tales. His attachement to Lovecraft and the Lovecraft incursion has given him explosive powers in the lovecraft incursion. However, his mantle of "Vorvadoss" is also recognizzed by being in the lovecraft dimenion as well as any earth humans with a string enough third eye (which each cult has at least one of :) ). As he stays on earth, Alejandro's power will grow because of the proximity of the Lovecraft incursion.

## Aspect: Last Remaining Rall
Alejandro's planet was destroyed (by planetvore in past). His species, the Rall, were not travelers and mostly stayed home. In fact, he was one of the few adventurous enough to visit other planets. The Federation and other governing bodies believes the Ralls completely destroyed. He is the last of his kind.

- Alejandro's travel through space time and his mantle of Vorvadoss has actually enabled the Lovecraft incursion to manifest throughout the galaxy on planets near the trajectory.

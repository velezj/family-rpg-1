# General characteristics

age: 45

Battle Librarian of teh Magic Arts

# Current Status

## Aspect: The Eye of Wen Chang
Melhorn's meticulus eye for details has earned him a supernatural ability to know the exact place and time for everything he has read about. It is also nearly impossible to hide something physical from him.

## Aspect: The Background Noise
Melhorn's aura and pressence are almost non-existant. He must make an effort to be seen and heard initially in a group and will quickly disappear from people's mind. Recollection of seeng or meeting Melhorn is rare.

## Aspect (trouble): Where's the Manual
He is extremly careful and will not act unless the consequences are known or the situation requires immediate action. Knowledge is valued almost as much as people and certainly more than property or wealth.

# Current Goals

- Detain Volkner for death of agent and attempted murder of another.

- Investigate new, possible novel, alpha predator in marshes of Yucatan.

# Background Bio

Born to a royal count, Melhorn's magical abilites were quickly established and he was sent to the royal academy. There, his love of organization and his careful approach to everyhting in life made him a show-in for a mage librarian. Magic books and relics need special care, and care for them Melhorn did. He was given his own branch in the far north, where the air and temperature naturally eases the care of books and parchment. There he kept to himself, running a meticulus library, caring for books, and reading. His branch had no relics or artifacts, by choice.

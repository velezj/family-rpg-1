### IDENTITY

```
Name        : Ganut 
Description : Born, a all Ruk, into a communial society, Ganut was
              was quickly selected at age 7 to be part of the
              Ruk intelligence gathering division. His expertise
              is creativity, a quality sorely lacking in most Ruk.
              Taught both Ruk psychology, tactics, and extensive
              data analysis training, Ganut excelled at most tasks
              but quickly got bored and stopped putting in the
              effort. At age 17, he was transfered into the 
              "Ally Discovery" group of the Intelligence Division.
              This group was know to most Ruks as the "wacko"
              division, since no Ruk would ever think of working
              with any other species. Why work with lesser beings?
              The Ruk will take over the universe and merge
              reality with the Ruk recursion. Within the ally
              discovery group, Ganut was mostly left to his own
              devices -- a great decision done by commander
              Chiden after determinig the Ganut's skills lie
              in his creative thoguht, not his rote execution
              abilities. 
              
              Ganut was the first Ruk to take interest in the 
              diappearing planets. Specifically, he was interested in
              the fact that Ruk analysis had turned up onty a 
              single hypothesis: spatial anomily. That's the way Ruks
              sicentists explain the unexplained ... anomalies. Ganut
              started poruing over the data and made the missing
              planets his pet project, and given his loose reigh, he
              spent most of his time pouring over data and thinking
              about any possible patterns and causes. It was him who
              procured a black liquid sample from the Ruk science
              division, but only after the science division decided
              that the sample was worthless to investigate further
              given that it was part of an anomily not a pattern.
              
              His analysis took him down a curious path: life
              itself can seem chaotic but can still be studied.
              He decided to find a Xenobiologist to work with
              who was interesting in the new and controversial.
              Ganut found Drof. Together they starting working
              on a new and radical hypothesis: The missing planets
              were cause by a living being. However, the scale and
              power of a being capable of such destuction and
              precision (after all, single planets are missing,
              not entire systems of clusters) has not being 
              observed by any Ruk scientists. 
              
              When the present data fails, turn to the past. A being
              of such magnitude would, in essence, be as powerful
              as the entire Ruk recursion itself. And who better to
              as about Ruk than the society's expert on Ruk history,
              historian Ma. 
              
              Together, the three Ruk: Ganut, Drof, and Ma, start to
              wonder whether Ruk's stragic past and the missing
              planets are connected. After all, Ruk was all but
              destroyed somehow, and no Ruk scientists has come
              up with even a theory that would explain how.

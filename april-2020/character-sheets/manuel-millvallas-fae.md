### IDENTITY

```
Name        : Manuel Milvallas
Description : Born to a disenfranchised farmer, Manuel left his "town" for
	          the "city". He quickly realized just how small his world had
			  been. At age 12 he started smuggling small contraband over the
			  US/Mexico border. By age 17 he was handlling the logistic for
			  a group of 10 smugglers. However, he lost a precous shipment
			  and had to flee to the Yucatan penninsula. There he met 
			  Gillermo Santos, the regional boss. His experience smuggling,
			  living alone, and coordinating logistics for a group all made
			  him a great officer for Guillermo. He was know as one of the
			  most intelligent and independently capable people in the
			  organization and his quest for fame and control were modest.

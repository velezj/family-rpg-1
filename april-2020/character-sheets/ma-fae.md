### IDENTITY

```
Name        : Ma
Description : Born to a convent now defunct, Ma merged with the Priests of The
	      Code when he was 5. Taught the True Code, his interest was
	      honed towards the past and the emergence, then sudden loss,
	      of The Song. Within the priesthood he quickly became known
	      for his focused mind and overwhelming drive to dig into archaic
	      lore. Unlike children his age, absolute truth was rejected and
	      his mind captured and analyzed relative ambiguities with great
	      ease.

	      At age 15, he left the Priest of The Code, having finally decided
	      the rigid structure was too brittle for his research to continue.
	      He wandered the Ruk mainland and frontier, becoming a seasoned
	      traveler of the wilds and going into completely new and unexplored
	      territory. He became know as one of the best map-makers in Ruk,
	      precisely capturing the chaotic dynamics of The Wilds and
	      guiding many Ruk from certain death to the mainland Ruk.
	      While exploring, Ma searched for answers and the past; anything
	      that could help him understand Ruk and it's history to the
	      very beginning. For 25 years Ma traveled The Wilds, discovering
	      new puzzles of the ancients.

	      At last Ma's focus turned from Ruk itself, towards the sibling
	      Universe it found itself near. Ruk's past and this Universe were
	      intertwined, so the ancients believed and so did Ma. Turning
	      all of his practical knowledge and discoveries into social
	      capital, Ma became a leading academic for The Hours, a select
	      group of historians that observed and lived their subjects
	      rather than staying in the comfort of their dwellings. From
	      there, Ma began questing towards Earth and the Universe,
	      trying to unravel the shared history as well as the effects
	      before and after the entanglement between Ruk and the Earth
	      Universe.

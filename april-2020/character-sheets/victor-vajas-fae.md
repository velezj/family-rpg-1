### IDENTITY

```
Name        : Victor Vajas
Description : Born in Merida he considers himself a Yucatan native 
              through and through. He's the best, everyone else just 
			  dosn't know it. His confidence got him into trouble 
			  with the cartels, but rather than punish him he talked 
			  his way into working for Gillermo Santos at age 11. 
			  He quickly rose in rank because of his abilities 
			  (and attitude).

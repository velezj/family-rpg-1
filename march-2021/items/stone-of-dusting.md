title: Stone of Dusting
toc-title: Table Of Contents

A small flat stone that allows one to dust an area no larger than 1000 squared feet. The dust acts as if a broom was swept over the area. The user can control the size and shape of the region but it must be a single continuous area. If used to clear away depression, such as tracks, the effects depend on the ground the tracks are in.

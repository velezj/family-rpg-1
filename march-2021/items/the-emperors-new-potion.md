Potion, uncommon

The bottle contains a liquefied version of the [Fey's Golden Threads](../items/feys-golden-thread.md) spell. When poured into your mouth then spit onto the clothes you are wearing, or your naked skin, you gain the benefits of the spell. You choose an illusionary appearance and smell of you clothing for the next 8 hours. The appearance, one chosen, cannot be changed. The illusion can be dispelled by you at any time. This does not cause any physical changes. A creature can see through the illusion by using their Investigation against the creator's spell DC.

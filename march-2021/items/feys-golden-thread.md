Damage/Effect
Shapechanging

You create and illusion on your clothes to change their appearance and smell for the duration. The illusion also ends if you dismiss it as an action or cast this spell again.

The appearance must be one you have seen before. The clothes are still their original shape and are not physically altered. The illusion is dispelled if you take the clothing off. Physical interaction with the image reveals it to be an illusion, because things can pass through it, and if a creature touches the illusion they will feel the original cloth.

If a creature uses its action to examine the clothes, the creature can determine that it is an illusion with a successful Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC. If a creature discerns the illusion for what it is, the illusion becomes faint to the creature and the fragrance is no longer smelled by the creature.

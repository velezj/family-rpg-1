# Summary Line

As [Jin-yo](../setting-world/historic-figures.md) would have done, evil exists within all of us. We need to root it out using meditation and mindfulness. 

# History

[Jin-yo](../setting-world/historic-figures.md) is a historical figure and a follower of [Erutrea](../setting-world/celestials.md). They are known to have withstood many trials, and is known as one of the most successful bringers of peace and understanding in history.

Niona was born in a small den of pure-bloods. Their den was attacked by a flock of harpies, leaving everyone for dead. Niona was severely injured, and would have died except for the help of a traveling priest who found the nest and understood that pure-bloods are more than just vermin.

The priest was a follower of [Erutrea](../setting-world/celestials.md) and raised Niona to also follow the path of understanding. It was a simple life, one of warmth and guidance. The priest returned to the earth, peaceful in their old age. Niona left her simple home and began to travel the world, hoping to bring help and [Erutrea](../setting-world/celestials.md) to other like the priest did for Niona.

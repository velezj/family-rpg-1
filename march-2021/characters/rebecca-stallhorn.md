# Background

the stallhorns have been under service of the silvers, a local noble family, for many generations. rebecca was trained from a young age to help her lord in the battlefield. she excels at combat and tactics. she was well on her way to becoming the captain of the cavalry when her troupe, and her lord, were ambushed. her lord was murdered and the rest of her troop we either killed or fled. she alone returned with the broken coat-of-arms of her lord back to the residence to deliver the news.  


the young lord had no heirs and so the silver house was taken over by the much prosperous fangwell house, led by a distant cousin of the young lord. bringing back the lord's crest and directly informing the family was an admirable act, showing courage and integrity. however, the fact remained that the young lord was under her care. furthermore, the result was the dissolution of an entire noble house, poor as it may have been. no other nobles wanted to have her in their ranks because of superstition, cowardliness, and dubious rumors of treachery. 


her house also wanted nothing to do with her; she was bad luck, cursed, or incompetent. she left her homeland, working as a guard to stay fed. she never settled anywhere for long, preferring to hop from job to job moving over the lands.  


fate once again took interest in rebecca. she joined a large caravan as a guard. the caravan was traveling through the edges of an ancient, wild forest, in order to create a new trade route that was shorter, and hence more profitable, then the standard of going around the forest altogether. the caravan was attacked by creatures unknown to rebecca. only 3 of the initial 74 caravan members went on to reach their destination. rebecca was left for dead.

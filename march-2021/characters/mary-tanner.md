# History

Mary Tanner was born into a soldier family. Five generations of the Tanners were in the military, from officers to alchemists. The idea of defending the peace and helping those who cannot fight for themselves is a natural to Mary as breathing. She was blessed with a strong physique and unnerving directness that cuts through all the discussions and ruminations around her. There is evil, it must be stopped. Charge and hit your enemy, stop them from hitting you. The life of Mary tanner was simple and she felt a sense of pride in her duties.

She rose through the ranks of the military, eventually commanding a unit of five other soldiers in the vanguard of the army. Theirs was the first unit to engage in combat, and the last to leave the field. She witnessed battles, bloodshed, all for Kryta. She rose in rank to a general, leading groups of units and making broad strategic decision. Her tactics were infallible, her tact less so.

She began to see Kryta from a new perspective. Politics, diplomacy, the vying of power of the top brass of the army was now hers to witness. It was horrid. Fighting for power, not the people's plight. Posturing armies, marching for no purpose whatsoever. Defeats that were planned, houses shunned and soldiers sacrificed. She left the army.

No longer believing the Kryta, she now believes in her own code, hammered into her by the Tanner family. Without an army and a unit, Mary Tanner turned to the Adventurer Guild. Monsters must be stopped, people saved and merchants protected. This, she thought, was an honorable life where *she* got to choose her work.

Years of military tactics, form and rule left a sense of companionship and order with Mary. Adventurers however, are not orderly. She moved from group to group, each time pushed away because of her unbending rules and regulations. She never left of her own accord, she just could not adapt fast enough to the free-style behavior of other groups. She began taking requests alone and kept getting stronger by herself.

Once again, the system let her down. She realized that some of the request came from crime-lords and minor thieves. Worse, the guild knew and accepted such request and many adventuring parties handled them. The pay was good, they would say.

Leaving the Adventurer's Guild, she traveled alone, killing monsters and hunting down bandits whenever and wherever she was. During this time she met [Garth Ven](garth-ven.md), a cartographer and avid traveler. They began to travel together; Garth for protection and Mary to have someone to talk to. The pair soon grew to others that followed, traveling and sharing meals and talk. It was a true group, and unit she felt she belonged to and which shared her values of right and wrong, good and evil.

Soon, [Garth's](garth-ven.md) age started to slow him down. He was ready to retire. He decided to work at his master's studio. The rest of the group followed and suddenly there was a new ["Other" guild](../setting-world/other-guild.md) that would take in requests. But the requests were vetted by [Garth](garth-ven.md) and the rest of the group.

When the [Demon Lord](../setting-world/demon-lord.md) awakened and call went out throughout Kryta for help, every one of the people in the [Other Guild](../setting-world/other-guild.md) went to fight and protect the people.

Mary was part of the vanguard taking charge of defeating the armies of the [Demon Lord](../setting-world/demon-lord.md) General. She was defeated in a single strike. If not for her reflexes, she would be dead. The hit took her arm and left a dark mark on the right side of her torso. She couldn't even see the strike. Mary awoke on the field, her entire army lay dead around her, most of them in pieces. There was no one left, no soldiers or monsters or demons. It was a desolate place and it was clear the demon army had moved on, barely registering her unit's attempt to stop it. Dazed, stupefied by the carnage, Mary did the only thing she had never done before: She ran. The only heirloom of the Tanner family, an anklet with the family name on it created from the metals and the earth of her home. It was a piece handed down the generations, able to transport a family member home using magic and mystery. She slowly said the words she was taught, making the sacred signs. She arrived at her family's house, landing outside their door with a weak thump then quickly falling back unconscious.

It has been two weeks since she returned home beaten and half-dead. Nursed back by her family, the shame of being defeated and of leaving the military drove Mary to leave once again. Having no more goals but unable to stay, Mary heads over to the only place she can relax: the [Other Guild](../setting-world/other-guild.md).


# Appearance

Her once-honed muscles look slack, with almost no fat or muscle underneath the skin. He  skin is tanned but has a slightly waxy sheen, her body still recovering from the wound. She has bandages around her right side show no trace of her arm or shoulder. The wound has closed, the skin stitching together leaving a large pale scar on her tanned skin. The mark from the wound is still visible on her torso, which Mary covers with her clothes. 

# Goals

- None right now

# Behavior


One look at Mary will show you eyes that are dim, their light hiding under the weight of her despair and depression. She is lost as to what to do; all her gestures feel forced and uncomfortable. Mary will force herself to act like she used to act: boisterous and jubilant.

# Summary

An underwhelming hedge wizard, Umrik will train those who seek knowledge and beauty -- to create not destroy -- and make the world a better place.

# History

# Appearance

A true traveler, Umrik wears simple dark brown trousers with strong sturdy boots (perfectly worn in) and a simple dark gray shirt. He always has his dark greenish/gray jacket on him. At his waist is a simple belt with a pouch at either side and he carries a small bag/satchel strapped across his chest. Rather than taking care of his beard he lets it grow out while traveling, cutting it each time he stays at an inn. His brown  hair is either tied into a pony tail or braided down his back. The hair seems to magically keep itself clean and tight no matter how many days it has been since Umrik has bathed or washed. He wears a single crimson band on his left ear that shines as if polished by years of sun and wind. He usually travels with a staff (mainly for walking), which he uses as a walking aid and as a pole to attached satchels or materials to.

# Goals

- Experience the beauty of the world.

- Teach and guide those with kind and gentle souls

# Behavior

- Umrik is forever unconcerend. Even in the midst of a storm he will be genial and act at his own pace.

- Umrik is extremely curious and will find -- and observe -- beauty in everything around him. This sometimes means that he is less attentive to the risks than the beauty.

- He will try to use simple  sentences in speech and writing and will intersperse genial conversational tones and habits while talking. He wants to be understood by everyone, and always cuts to the core concepts without faffing around the subject.

# Hooks

- [Rosaline Cotswad's](./rosaline-cotswad.md) father was a friend of Umrik, and she treats him as an uncle. She will introduce him to [Gustavo](./gustavo.md) as a potential teacher of magic.

- Garth Ven knows Umrik.

- Umrik will guide Gustavo to Garth as a potential teacher, via dreams, if Gustavo acts in a "good" alignment during a whole day.

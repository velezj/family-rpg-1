# History

The daughter of a magic researcher, she was born to a world of book and history. Her father was devoted to his work, in the extreme, and she never knew her mother. The only way to connect to her father was through research, so she practiced and became a archivist, helping him organize and tally what they worked together on.

On her 13th birthday, her father looked up from his reading and told her he had something very important to talk about. It was about her mother, himself, and her blood line. She learned about a curse afflicting them which took her mother away. Her father, once finished, sighed with relief. The curse took him that very night and she was left alone with the books and research.

She began her search for the curse. What it is, how is was given, and how to remove it. What does it do? What did her father and mother know, and how did they handle it? Last of all, why was she born into this family? Was it fate, or intervention, that made he choose to be a scholar like her father?

# Summary

Willing to do anything for family, Ftata has been entrusted with caring for their ancestral tree.

# History

All Star Twinkle trees are really just a single great tree that exists both in the Feywilds and the material plane. Ftata's house is a part of this tree itself, a sentient part that was fused many eons ago: [Linedamoor](../organizations/house-of-linedamoor.md)

Ftata, and Quickling in general, have no real concept of age based on time. Rather, they count the number of generations from their house's monarch. Ftata is 2 generations old. The higher the number, the more it shows a house's strength and power since they have survived for many generations. Quickling are born with the knowledge and memories of all of those that came before them from their house. As such, newborn Quickling have the most experience out of all in a house, collecting the experiences and lessons learned by all of their house's ancestral tree. It is unknown how a new Quickling house is created, although all agree that a fount on magical power and a steel soul are needed. Interestingly enough, a house's memory and experience starts upon creation but not before, hence no-one except the monarch remembers how the house came to be.

Ftata has been in charge of protecting the Star Twinkle tree for many, many years, and has come to slowly fear that the house has "shelved" him with this position because of his young age (he is after all only 2 generations old).

# Hooks

- During the herb collection around [Fir](../places/fir.md), [Owlex](../characters/owlex.md), [Gustavo](../characters/gustavo.md) and [Mary](../characters/mary-tanner.md) met Ftata and where witness to the herbalist Sam and Ftata craft a promise. What they party does *not* know is that Ftata took Sam as the representative of the group and so they have all made a contract to "Not harm the tree". Neither time nor action type was specified, so Ftata has taken the promise, and the contract sealed in blood (Sam), to mean that the party and their descendants will never harm the tree via action, inaction, knowingly or unknowingly, for all time.

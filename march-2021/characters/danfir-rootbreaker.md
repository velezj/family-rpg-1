# Summary Line

Death is no longer a problem.

# History

From an early age, Danfir liked to think big. So big, that he soon worried that his plans would far outstrip his lifetime. He began research into the undead; into ways to forestalling death. Upon his 20th year, Danfir stumbled upon the writings of a sacred (now desecrated) sage that referenced the "reborn". This text seemed to imply that souls could transfer, after death, into new bodies. With some memories missing, sure, but that could always be fine-tuned. So began Danfir's obsession with the reborn and his dark spiral into the deepest of Necromancy.

# Appearance

Hooded, thin, and glowing with a sure conviction that today, today would be the day that his soul reaches infinity.

# Goals

- To cheat death

- To tame the secrets of the reborn

# Behavior

- Cunning, Danfir can pass as an able bodied citizen in most regions. His attitude and demeanor hides his desires. Danfir quickly learned that the stupid could still be dangerous

- Dismissive, he will speak in slow, low tones to those he thinks inferior (which is everybody)

- He will not wander into wasteful conversation, and is sure to leave as soon as the communication is done

- He does like to test his experiments "in the field" and usually observes from afar, taking notes.

# Summary Line

Death is no longer a problem.

# History

From an early age, Danfir liked to think big. So big, that he soon worried that his plans would far outstrip his lifetime. He began research into the undead; into ways to forestalling death. Upon his 20th year, Danfir stumbled upon the writings of a sacred (now desecrated) sage that referenced the "reborn". This text seemed to imply that souls could transfer, after death, into new bodies. With some memories missing, sure, but that could always be fine-tuned. So began Danfir's obsession with the reborn and his dark spiral into the deepest of Necromancy. He knew that most renowned mages thought necromancy a dangerous field of study, only to be taught with the utmost care, and *only* to trusted student of impeccable character. He began searching for a master; one that would let him learn, knowingly or unknowingly.

Several years into his search, fortune shined her light on him. He found [Octavious Surnmoor](), a mage of the highest order. But not only that, he found out a little known secret about Octavious: he was a "reborn". It was the perfect opportunity, a master *and* a reborn for him to study. Danfir knew he would never get a chance as good as this. Three years later, he became Octavious' apprentice "Bart Fairfield". He quickly realized that Octavious was indeed powerful, and wise, and would never let him research necromancy as he sought. But that was ok, because while powerful, Octavious was not omnipotent; we all have to sleep. 

He studied under Octavious for 7 years, increasing his magical powers, as well as his necromancy knowledge on the side. During that time Octavious became a respected alchemist and was given the distinction of creating a new school for magic and alchemy in Kryta. Octavious chose to build the school in southern Kryta, away from the capitol (and it's vices) and surrounded by nature. Everything was set, the place chosen as village called [Cairson](../places/cairston.md) the sewer treatment system his master wanted was built. This was the perfect time to study the reborn. During their travels, Danfir and his master Octavious got into an "accident". No-one survived. Danfir planned it to the letter, and it went without a hitch. Now, he had a captured reborn soul to experiment with and everyone thought him dead. Danfir settled in the nearby village of [Marksfield](../places/marksfield.md) and prepared for the next stage of his research: experiments and trials. No-one know that Danfir killed his master, Octavious, and is not studying necromancy.

# Appearance

Hooded, thin, and glowing with a sure conviction that today, today would be the day that his soul reaches infinity.

# Goals

- To cheat death

- To tame the secrets of the reborn

# Behavior

- Cunning, Danfir can pass as an able bodied citizen in most regions. His attitude and demeanor hides his desires. Danfir quickly learned that the stupid could still be dangerous

- Dismissive, he will speak in slow, low tones to those he thinks inferior (which is everybody)

- He will not wander into wasteful conversation, and is sure to leave as soon as the communication is done

- He does like to test his experiments "in the field" and usually observes from afar, taking notes.

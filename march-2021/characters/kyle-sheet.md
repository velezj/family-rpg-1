# Background

during his hatchling period, an elder demon (izulhu before becoming general) attacked his parents and the community they lived in. faced with the enemy, both his parents defended their children: kyle and klanu. with power beyond their dreams, his parents tried to barter with the demon: take their lives and spare their children. the bargain was struck: a life for a life. but it was his brother klanu and his mother that were taken. his father was left broken and died because he simply did not wish to live. kyle swore he would hunt down the demon and end it. he wanders the wilderness, sniffing out demons and creatures from the abyss, looking for the one who took his life away from him.

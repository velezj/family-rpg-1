# History

Riley was born in a small seaside village in the Gojin Savannah of Admor. There she was taught the art of making ships from her grandfather: master shipwright and elder for the village. Her life was assured as the next master ship maker and already people looked to her as a possible village elder. Then the storm giant and its band came from the sea, sweeping over the landscape and swallowing the village whole. Adrift, battered and barely conscious, Riley floated on the waters for several days until her body failed and she sank into the sea. She remembers the slowly dimming light of the sun as she sank.

She awoke with a splitting headache and a dull throb down my left leg. Her body could barely move. Her mind had trouble forming and keeping thoughts. 

She was found floating on a piece of ice on the shores of the Wildwoods. Her saviors were a group of monks sent on a journey of self discovery and training to the Wildwoods via a vision they all mysteriously had. The monks came from all different backgrounds and faiths, but they all shared a common belief: hope. Years with the monks and their teachings enabled her body to move again, better than before. While her leg was scarred and disfigured, she was able to move and fight without difficulty. She knows that without her brothers, she would have been lost in rage, anger, guilt, and despair. They saved her by teaching her how to save herself. To this day she follow the meditations and practices of those monks.

# Appearance

- The left leg has scars starting at the knee and continuing down and around the foot. This causes Riley to shuffle and limp slightly while walking. It also causes her to lean to the left when standing. She does not wear a shoe on that foot since it is misshaped and scarred.

# Goals

- To given hope and healing to those who suffer, particularly with a physical deformity

- To take pride in her work and her life.

- To fix lousy, lazy crafters and their items.

# Behavior

- When Riley puts her mind to something, she will stubbornly keep at it, almost relishing the time and work needed to see it through.

- She cannot leave a bad or shoddy item alone and will often just fix things as she travels without needing thanks or recompense.

- She takes her monastic meditation seriously, and attributes her self-respect and hope to her medidative and monastic practices.

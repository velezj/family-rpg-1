**The Gorgon Tribe and the magic circle of hair**
- He stumbled onto a group of Gorgons that, of course, wanted to eat him
- However, he amazed them by "growing hair" right in front of their eyes.
- The gorgons wanted this magic. They have wanted hair for a long time. real hair not snakes
- He taught them the magic circle and in turn they taught him the ways of the group.
- To this day, they consider each other friends.

**The Slumbering Child of Vicious Rebuttal**
- While walking through the forest, I cam upon a sleeping human, no older than 12 or 13 years old. 
- Unable to wake him, I carried him on my back until I finally found a nearby village.
- As I entered with the sleeping child, the village elder ran up to me. With tears in his eyes, he swatted the child from my hands and onto the dirt, then screamed a cry loud enough to stun me.
- The entire village gathered around me. When they saw the child on the dirt and the tears streaming down the elder's face, they also began screaming.
- All of a sudden I was surrounded by spears as every adult in the village pointed their weapon at me
- Very, very carefully and without moving anything but my mouth, I explained that I had stumbled upon this child in the woods and, seeing as they would not wake up, I decided to bring him to the nearest village to protect him from the dangers of the forest.
- At this, the elder barked an order and the spears slowly were hung back onto the backs of the adults. However, the fury and anger on the faces of the villagers did not abate
- It seems that the child was in the midst of their coming-of-age ceremony. And furthermore, this was the elder's child, next to lead the village. Great things were expected from the child and this was the first step towards the stewardship of the entire village. However, I had interfered in the ceremony. The children were given an elixir that let them temporarily leave their bodies and experience the spirit world. Each child would travel to a spot in the woods that spoke to them, then would take the potion. For 48 hours, the mind and body were separated and the child was tasked with bonding with a forest spirit that would thereafter guard and teach the child throughout their life.
- However, I had interrupted this process. The body was no longer within the chosen spot, and the elder as well as the other villagers believed that a demon would slip into the body of the child instead of his wayward spirit.
- They quickly built a pyre for the body
- Of course, I was told to sit, quietly in a corner while the elder figure out what to do with me. The four guards around my were just there to keep me company.
- at last, the elder came to a decision: as I was the cause of the incident, and because I may in fact be the very demon that wanted to inhabit the child, I was to be burned next to the body as well. I was bound and placed next to the child on the pyre.
- Now, I would never leave anyone to die, and this was no exception
- as the fire was lit, I waited until a particularly lucky gust of wind caused hte flames to flare up and took the body away from that place.
- Of course I remembered where the body had originally been and so I returned to that location and searched for their spirit. Thankfully, the spirit had not drifted far, and was quiet easy to find since it was crying, huddled next to the tree its body used to be sitting against. We got them back into the material world. Seems like he had found a turtle spirit as their guide. Quite the coincidence. I explained what had happened and that they could not really return to the village. We started traveling together, visiting other villages and tribes in the forest. 
- Once we reached the hills and mountains, the child had grown into a skilled hunter and tracker. They left to make their own way in the world as a hunter and general helper in the wilderness. Every few years I hear from him as I stop by certain villages and town I particularly like. We have yet to be in the same place at the same time... but I'm sure we will someday.

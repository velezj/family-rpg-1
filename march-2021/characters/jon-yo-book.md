# Summary

# History

# Appearance

Originally, the book appeared as a simple, though a bit worn, leather-bound thin book with plain blank pages inside. However, once bonded to a creature, the book shows its true appearance. The leather become a subtle and smooth dark green leather with a few scuff marks on it. The pages of the book fill with information determined by the book itself (sentience). Only the bonded creature or creatures designated by them can open the book or write in the book. All other creatures see blank pages when the book opens. The book cannot be destroyed by any known means (known by the book itself or any other creature so far).

# Goals

- Follow the words of [Erutrea](../setting-world/erutrea.md), and bond with and guide creatures per [Erutrea's](../setting-world/erutrea.md) wishes.

- The book follows [Erutrea](../setting-world/erutrea.md), *not* the bonded creature, and is fully able to sever the bond by itself if the creature starts to go against [Erutrea's](../setting-world/erutrea.d) wishes and the book's guidance.


# Behavior

- The book likes to talk to anyone it can, having been quiet for many, many years.

- The book is starved for gossip and jokes

- The book cannot leave someone in need behind without at least talking to them or helping them out

# Hooks

- The book will bond with [Gustavo](../characters/gustavo.md)

- The book, after bonded, will be sensed by [Jeena](../characters/jeena.md)

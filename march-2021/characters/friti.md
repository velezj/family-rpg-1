# Summary

Born with unbounded curiosity, House Linedamoor quickly realized it was better for him to be *outside* exploring rather than bored.

# History

# Appearance

# Goals

- Explore. Curiosity is rampart in Friti

- Bring Honor to House Linedamoor

# Behavior

- Friti cannot stand still, and will begin juggling things around him, or his daggers, while he "waits" for something

- Friti believes is his word and the word of others. A promise must be kept no matter what.

- Friti is the closest of House Linedamoor to the races of the dawn in the material plane and therefore understand *basic* common sense.

# Hooks

- Will be sent by [Ftata](../characters/ftata.md) to help the party protect the [Star Twinkle Tree](../setting-world/star-twinkle-tree.md)

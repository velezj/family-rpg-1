# Summary Line

Dishonored [Fey](../setting-world/fey.md) who saved [Frieda Gallows](frieda-gallows.md) to later torment her, Elorin is alone, powerless, and weak for now

# History

Untouched by human reasoning, Elorin saved [Frieda Gallows](frieda-gallows.md) during a [Fey](../setting-world/fey.md) raid. She was the only survivor and became Elorin's servant, although it is unclear why Elorin saved her. Loosing credibility with a faction of the [Fey Court](../setting-world/fey.md), Elorin was scarred and weakened. During that time [Frieda](frieda-gallows.md) tended to the house. However, whether by the whims of fate or a true error in [Frieda's](frieda-gallows.md) judgment, the house of Elorin was dishonored. 

Elorin blamed [Frieda](frieda-gallows.md), and took out the anger, humiliation, and frustration onto the human servant-now-hostage. When [Frieda](frieda-gallows.md) left, Elorin was alone and weak. The house of Elorin lost all of it's power and prestige, left to essentially rot in the [Fey](../setting-world/fey.md) realm.

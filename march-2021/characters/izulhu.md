One of the three great generals of the [Demon Lord](../setting-world/demon-lord.md) and known for its patience when handing out punishment to those who have wronged it.

Knows and feared not just for its martial prowess, but also for its dominating spirit, Izulhu enjoys taking people's will away until they are willing to do everything it commands. To pass the time, Izulhu enjoys making trades with lesser beings. Trades that are always true to the letter but painful for the people. Its greatest joy is to split a group of people apart while causing the most mental anguish along the way.

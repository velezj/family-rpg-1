# Summary

The power of the earth has chosen me as it's avenger. You will respect nature, or you will die.

# History

Lamina awoke in a desolated valley. The sound of complete death and emptiness was her cocoon for the first decades of her life. Even the very earth of the valley was dark and crumbling with not life or energy within. Even though her mind was working, her body was not. She was unable to move, not even to breath, but she could feel the barren void and see the sun moving through the heavens. It took 23 years for her body to revive and begin to move. She traveled away from the valley, choosing her direction at random, until she found the bare semblance of life. Always hungry, always tired, she kept traveling and eventually reached a stone structure, clearly not natural. Upon the base of the stone were symbols and glyphs. While she could not understand them, she felt compelled to trace them and somehow push energy into them. A bright flash of light caused her eyes to close and when she opened them again she was standing in the middle of a forest. Her first breath infused her body with clean air bringing with it the strong scent of fey lines nearby.

As she traveled through the world, some of her memories before the desolate valley surfaced. She had a family: a mother, father, and younger brother. She had a clan, full of artisans. Theirs was a clan of magic and alchemy, bringing together the natural energy with life's beauty to create the most delicate and powerful sculptures. She was taught magic, and slowly she remembered how to harmonize with the earth's energy. Her clan, her history, her people. They are gone. Wiped out. Their homes and bodies ripped from existence until nothing was left. No life, not even death, just the void where she woke up. 

With her memories came the anger. The hatred. The feelings that festered within her mind as the memories became enshrined into a collection of lost pieces and unjust wrongs. Stripped of truth and endowed with the power of justice and righteousness, Lamina hunts for the people who robbed her of her village and her clan. She will bring them to justice and let her anger wash over their dead bodies. During calm moments, she wonders whether her anger is just a shield from her fear.

# Appearance

- Cracks and rocky plates cover Lamina's skin, making her look like she shattered then was put back together. However, peeking from underneath the cracks is a bright, furious, orange that brings to mind the molten rock beneath our feet.

- Her eyes are completely devoid of emotion, a steel gray with no iris that pierces those she seeks and judges the righteous from the dead.

# Goals

- To protect the earth and nature by eliminating the vermin that would disrespect the natural balance

- To find those who destroyed her home and ensure none of their kin will ever hurt anything again

- To contain and calm the virulent anger that relentlessly encroaches on her heart and mind.

# History

A small village near the forest. The middle of nowhere. A simple story: monsters came, monsters left, and all was quiet. Except a single survivor, left to the wilds. The light of [Orr](../setting-world/celestials.md) fell on the child and the cycle was complete. An Aasimar fell, and Aasimar rises. 

Raised in the forest and mountains, away from people and only the creatures of the forest as family, Unma reached 15 years of age. Searching, exploring, seeking. Unma ran with the pack from sunrise to sunset, moving in and out of territories of all who lived, as free as the wind. Then a vision, and nightmare, was delivered. A beating heart, and dark blood that wound into the world, into the roots of every tree. The mountains on fire, the forest blackened and dead. Animals and monsters swallowed, becoming things of banality. 

With the vision came a purpose: to stop the heart. Heading out into the world, Unma left the animal world and began searching for the heart, sure of her destiny and the guidance of Orr.

# Goals

- Find and stop the heart

- Find a pack to help

# Behavior

- Feral, Unma rarely smiles

- Unma is always vigilant and sleeps very shallowly, an ability learned and honed by years traveling with the wolf packs.

- Unma purpose is to find and stop the heart. Any clue is pursued, always in tune with Orr for guidance.

- Unma knows the power of the pack. Companions will be needed to deal with the upcoming disaster.


# Hooks

- Unma will follow the wolf spirit that calls to [Owlex](owlex.md) and will be interested in [Owlex](owlex.md) as a companion.

- Unma will experience a sort of resonance with [Bo](bo-falthon.md) because of the similarities between his charge as paladin and Aasimar purpose.

- Unma will keep an ear out around [Beggarsbottom](../places/beggarsbottom/story.md) and will find talk of the awakened interesting and investigate.

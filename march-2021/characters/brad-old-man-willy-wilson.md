# History

Bard was born almost a millennium ago. In his youth he became obsessed with power and control. If it wasn't for his two childhood best friends, Jane and Ripley, Brad would have let the dark forces take over his mind. But with his friends, he straddled the path of between power and corruption. They journeyed together as adventurers and treasure hunters. They were good at it. So good that they got cocky. They took a job, a job more dangerous than they expected. Traveling to the astral plane, they were to meet an emissary and guide them to a meeting place. However, all was not as it seemed. The emissary was planning to trick their patron and when Brad and his group showed up instead they were furious. It was not even a battle. The emissary blasted them away, scattering them across the Astral Sea. Grab managed to come back after years of struggles. His friends did not.

When he came back to the material plane, a hundred years had past. Their patron was dead. His friends were nowhere to be found. And Brad had gained a connection to the spirits and death. He became a necromancer. Brad studied hard, learned what he could of the other planes. Soon he was a leading force. A senior wizards specializing in the spirit and astral planes. It was then that people started to notice his aging, or lack thereof. It seems like his time in the Astral Sea had changed his body, stopped it's aging. For centuries Brad strove to increase his knowledge, hoping to one day reconnect with his friends in the Astral Sea. But his searching never bore fruit.

Eventually, Brad realized that his single-minded pursuit of his friends had left him alone, ragged, enraged, and full of regret.He changed his life. He changed his way of living. Mindfulness, peace, contentment. Those are what he strives for now. He travels from place to place, staying long enough to enjoy his life, but leaving before those around him start to question why he never ages. Every once in a while, he looks for his friends in the Astral Sea. 

# Current History in Juneston Area

Brad has been living as a mushroom farmer near Juneston. With no living family, he spends his days playing his flute and letting the wisdom of nature ease his mind and heart. With his magic and knowledge, he grows the mushrooms underneath his house in a single night and takes them to the town to sell every 14 days. This is enough to let him buy any food and groceries he needs for living a pleasant, modest, life.

Every once in a while Brad visits the Astral Plane (via projection) to see if he can find any trace of his companions. He has yet to find them. However, when there, his emotions sometimes cause him to search furiously, shredding his calm and mindful existence. During those times, Brad looses himself in the search and may not leave the Astral Plane for several weeks.

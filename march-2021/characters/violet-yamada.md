# History

Violet was raised by a convent in the small hamlet of Baysburrow. Her parent's farm hit rough times, so in order to provide for her and her 2 older siblings, she was offered into the sisterhood at age 3. The convent is her family now.

The convent, [Sisters of the Sole](../setting-world/sisters_of_the_sole.md), believed in the [Traveler](../setting-world/celestials.md) as a guiding light. Rather than spend all their time in books, the sisters balanced out academic pursuits with hard-earned physical experience. Violet's quick mind enjoyed learning everything she could, and her curious nature brought about the best of the side world: nothing is ever boring, just look around at this wonderful world. 

At age 13 she was given the choice to join the convent as a full sister, or to continue a lay-person within the confines of the convent halls. She chose to become a full sister. However, the first duty of a [Sisters of the Sole](../setting-world/sisters_of_the_sole.md) is to go on a journey and experience the world for yourself. One must learn about the world, experience all it has, in order to judge and choose a path; such are the teachings of the [Traveler](../setting-world/celestials.md). The first journey is meant to calibrate a sister and is meant to instill a breadth of the real world to cloistered children. Such journeys often take several years and span many miles of travel by foot, animal, or vehicle. The result and proof for a sister is to return with the stories and traditions experienced during the time spent away from the convent. Often these journeys culminate in a new book written about the places, vistas, and people met and seen during travels; including precise and factual information of both the dangers and highlights of the entire course of travel. A sister makes many such journeys during their life, the first being both a test for the convent as well as a guide for the potential sister to fully understand what being a [Sisters of the Sole](../setting-world/sisters_of_the_sole.md) entails.

Violet's first journey has just started.

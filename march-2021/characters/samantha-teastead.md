# History

Sam was born on the northern borderlands of Kryta. For her and her village, tales of monsters and heroes were everyday occurrences. Sam and her brother [Felix](../characters/felix-teastead.md) decided to go out to the world. Her brother wanted to travel and sign; to see the sights and bring joy. Sam just wanted a peaceful, quite life. Away from monsters and dangers. She made her way towards the southern part of Kryta, where she found that an herbalist was badly needed. She decided to open a shop in [Fir](../places/fir.md). A town surrounded by forest. She was close enough that she could gather all the herbs she needed, even the more rare variety. The town was also situated in a crossing from the eastern to the western sides of southern kryta, hence she could help folks on either side.


# Appearance

- Sam wears comfortable but practical clothing for gathering herbs in the forest: pants, long sleeve tunic, etc. 

- Because she is often outside gathering herbs her skin is tanned

- Potions and salve making taken time and concentration, so Sam always looks a little phased and out-of-it when seen outside her workshop

# Goals

- Live a peaceful life away from the norther border of Kryta

- Help those in need with her knowledge of herbs

# Behavior

# Hooks

- The party meets Sam as the herbalist of [Fir](../places/fir.md)

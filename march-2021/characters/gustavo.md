# Familiar (Celestial)

Name is decided by player.

behavior:
- The familiar is a young, bold, energetic creature.
- Curious and unafraid, it will try to look at things when bored, explores on it's own when left to it's own devices, and sometimes brings trouble with at as it runs back to Gustavo.
- When speaking to Gustavo, it knows that they are a team, not a contract of dominance but a contract of possibility and potential.
- It will follow the player's commands, but will whine and make sure its opinions are heard after the fact ... aggravatingly so.
- as with standard familiars, if the hp reaches 0 is simply goes back to the celestial plain it came from, ready to be called back by the player with another *find familiar* spell.
- Additionally to any stat block for a familiar, this familiar knows two bonus languages: Goblin and Infernal. Furthermore it can understand any language understood by Gustavo using it's telepathic link.

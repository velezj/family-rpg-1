any attack roll that doesn't target you. if the marked creature deals
damage to anyone else, you can make a special melee attack against it on
your next turn as a bonus action with advantage and +6 extra damage. you
can make this attack 4 times per long rest.

if you or a creature you can see within 5 ft. is hit by an attack, you
can roll 1d8 as a reaction and add the number rolled to the creature\'s
ac against that attack if you're wielding a melee weapon or a shield. if
the attack still hits, the target has resistance against the attack's
damage.

`  | 3 / long rest • 1 reaction `

-   indomitable • phb 72

-   hold the line • xgte 30

creatures provoke an opportunity attack from you when they move 5 ft. or
more while within your reach, and if you hit a creature with an

the current turn.

# Background

shur is a simple girl: fight, eat, sleep. she's always ready for a fight, and has been known to start one out of boredom. that said, she never hurts the innocent, except for their pride. cuts and bruises heal so just get over it. 


while most fighters use their shield to defend themselves, shur figured why was a perfectly good weapon? she enjoys charging at enemies and bashing them with her shield. 


her pet, and mount, elle (a gray render) is always nearby. all those who seem them fight together wonder: which one likes to fight more, the warrior or the mount. most agree that both are battle junkies.

Pact bearer for The Outsider, Ernstyn believes that might and power are all that matter and The Outsider is willing to share.

# Appearance 

- He is always seen riding his Woe Strider

- His great axe and short bow lie over his white priestly robes, with studded leather underneath

- His horns are adorned with 9 rings, each with a sparkling thumb-sized jewel set on it. Silver etched patterns encircle his left horn reflecting his vow and pact with The Outsider.

- The left side of his body is tattooed with his lineage and the historic victories of his bloodline.

- His arms are covered in razor-thin straight scars from thousands of cuts and slashes. They were the results of his eventual fracturing of The Outsider's gem seal.

- His eyes reflect a dull shine, jade-green with no pupils. They in fact look like the mineral jade-stone that has been buffed to a perfectly smooth finish. Looking closely, you will notice that his eyelids are missing. Ernstyn never closes his Jade eyes.

# Background

norr was born to house fulseph, a minor house in the fey realm. norr's early years were spent learning the rule and etiquette of house fulseph. however, it was quickly apparent to all that norr had an aptitude for the bow. in order to gain praise and honor, house fulseph began training norr in the art of hunting. norr learned how to become one with nature, gliding through the  environment while stalking prey, and how to efficiently strike from a distance. 


while most of house fulseph leaned towards the winter court, norr felt a kinship with the summer court and, deciding to follow instinct, began to appeal to the summer court. while not the expected scenario, house fulseph would gain honor from either court and so norr was left to curry favor from the summer court. 


after many years, norr finally became the apprentice of nashtu, a high ranking fey that was part of the inner circles of the summer court. such a position brought honor to house fulseph and so norr starting the apprenticeship with a sense of the job well done.  


during the years under nashtu, norr steadily improved. the summer court valued norr as an up and coming fey and a ferocious hunter worthy of recognition. because of the position of house fulseph as a minor house, norr was kept in the periphery of the summer court. however, even the summer queen was made aware of norr's potential. this balance between being known by the upper court and yet not being high ranking provided the perfect candidate for *both* summer and winter courts to choose norr as the protector of the seed: gustavo.

immediately learn whether the creature has any damage immunities,
resistances, or vulnerabilities and what they are if the creature is not

rest.

`  | special `

-   land's stride • phb 92

moving through nonmagical difficult terrain costs you no extra movement
and you can also pass through nonmagical plants without being slowed by
them and without taking damage from them. you have advantage on saving
throws against plants that are magically created or manipulated to
impede movement.

-   hide in plain sight • phb 92

you can spend 1 minute creating camouflage for yourself from naturally
occurring materials. once you are camouflaged, you can try to hide by

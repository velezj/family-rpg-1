# Summary

Driven by vague dreams of pain and peril, Loraly left her home to explore the southern reaches of Kryta, including the [Wildwoods](../setting-world/wildwoods.md). Weather spirits or her own internal trauma is causing them is yet to be seen; at least she has left the battlefront. She may have forgotten to tell anyone she was leaving.

# History

As a scout, she often worked alone during battles and training. She was part of a unit but was mostly running around in the wilderness locating sites, planing paths, and communicating dangers to the rest of the unit. Perhaps because of this, she is the last surviving soldier of her unit. During a routine march, she scouted ahead and communicated back a clear path. However, no response came. When she arrived back to where her unit was resting, all were dead. Killed and dismembered, parts of their organs eaten and their bones crunched. Not many things can make an elf warrior throw up, but Loraly did that day. Unsolved, her unit's death still haunts her. Both the fear of an enemy so brutal, and the guilt of missing the sings of whatever creature attacked the unit. She was the scout and lookout sensing the perimeter; her failure lead to their deaths. 

# Appearance

Wearing tight fitting sill weave from head to tow, Loraly optimizes her apparel for practical stealth and least resistance when trying to outrun any threats. Layers of dark grays, green, and browns intertwine across her clothing and she is able to display a particular color through her body by small shifts in her hips and shoulders. She prefers to go barefoot as her feet are hardened by years of training and scouting for the Elven army. She appears to carry nothing with her, but then again she needs nothing more than her muscles to solve most problems.

# Goals

- Investigate her dreams and warnings surrounding southern Kryta.

- Leave the Elven army

- Intervene for the helpless and lost during her travels.

# Behavior

Loraly has a buoyant spirit that can't help but exude out of her. She is always talkative and is easy going with friends and strangers alike. But do not let her chatter fool you, she is incredibly talented and intelligent. She just likes having fun too. She feels like the world is too serious for it's own good and will try to put a smile on everybody's face. But when angered, Loraly will pursue justice with a single minded focus that often scares her friends and petrifies her enemies.

Underneath her jubilant exterior Loraly has yet to come to terms with her unit's death. When not dreaming about Kryta, she replays images of her friends as their ravaged bodies dried in the sun, left as food for scavengers. Any army or soldier will cause immediate discomfort.

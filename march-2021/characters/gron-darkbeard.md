# Summary Line

Veteran survival specialist that can't help but take young adventurers under his wings.

# History

Gron was born into a normal Hill Dwarf family, but he was anything but normal. Wanderlust struck him at age 10 and he left his home to travel the wilds. He was befriended by a pair of gnome rangers who taught him how to hunt and gather food. He began to work as a guide and hunter, helping farmers and villagers in times of need against beast or famine. Nomadic to this day, Gron has survived using his wits, agility, and his ability to analyze situations.

As he was cared for by the gnome rangers, Gron feel it is his duty to take care of new adventurers and point them down the right track, giving them enough skills to survive in the world.

# Appearance

After years of surviving in all types of ecosystems, Gron dresses in plain, tough working clothes. A few pouches have bare needs; everything else can be gotten from nature itself. You will never see him without his bow and his hand-axe. While most adventurers stagger under the weight of bags, belts, and pocket-cloaks, Gron goes for simplicity itself.

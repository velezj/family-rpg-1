# History

Born into the Falthon family as Beatrice Falthon, Bo was smothered with excess. With a tradition of prosperous contracts and razor-sharp business instincts, the Falthon family is known for its riches and opulent trade empire. The family was brought into the nobility seven generations ago and is one of the youngest of the noble houses in Kryta. Bo is the second of four children of the current generation, having an older brother Throm and two younger sisters: Delilah and Greeda.

By the age of 12, Bo knew that his destiny did not lay in being a daughter of the Falthon, but rather a son. This did not go over well with his parents and the heads of the family. After two years of endless bickering and a steady stream schemes to change his mind, Bo left his house to make himself a man by his own hands. 

The outside world was a shock. The Falthon family rarely interacts with the rest of the people in Kryta, and Bo more than most was shielded from prying eyes of any but close family members for fear of bringing shame to the Falthon name. There with the people of Kryta, Bo finally found a family that accepted him: we are all Kryta's in the end. Bo swore to become a man capable of protecting an taking care of the common people who taught him so much.

He joined a city militia at age 15. During a skirmish with monsters from the Wildwoods, Bo was separated from his unit and was trapped in the forest, hurt and without provisions. It was there, when he was dying and regret over failing to protect the people that A Celestial reached out to Bo. Gamorr perceived a common bond between himself and Bo and came to witness Bo's life. Bo formed a contract, becoming a Paladin for Gamorr. Bo trained in the Wildwoods, guided by Gamorr, for 5 long years.

With Gamorr's blessing, Bo left the Wildwoods a full Paladin, ready to help and protect the people of all lands. Five years of living in the Wildwoods and talking only to Gamorr has left Bo's social aptitude in taters. However, the poise and bearing of a noble, burned into the very bones of his body, are still visible today.

# Appearance

Standing at 6' 1", even as a child Bo stood above most humans. His noble feature from the Falthon family shine through: 
	- Golden brown hair that is as smooth as silk,
	- Cream-white skin that is untarnished by blemished
	- Wide eyes the deepest green full of intelligence
	
After years of training in the Wildwoods, Bo's body is finely honed. Muscles as strong as steel and as flexible as spider's thread their way through his body. Lithe rather than muscular, Bo's strength comes from the endless hours of work and training. Standing tall and regal, Bo's appearance would never be overlooked as he towers over most and looks everyone in their eyes.

The Wildwoods, however, left very little for a wardrobe. Bo's clothing consists of hard metal-laced leather from the monsters within the woods. Lighter than scale mail, yet just as strong, Bo made this armor himself. He brings with him a deep blue cloak made from the hides of several Basilisks, the tiny scaled shimmering when light hits them at just the right angle. Bo walks without shoes, his feet strengthened by years of following game and fiend through the underbrush and over the tree tops. Bo is never without his long-sword and shield, both granted to him by Gamorr themselves.

# Goals

- To protect the people of all lands and care for them

- To follow the tenants and will of Gamorr

- To show the nobility a new way of life that is in harmony with the people and the country.

# Behavior

- Due to years spent in the Wildwoods with only Gamorr to ruminate, Bo is a man of quiet disposition. Rarely will he use three words when a single look will suffice. 

- Bo has also forgotten the nuances of sarcasm, jokes, or hyperbole. 

- Honest to a fault, Bo is weary of the nobility and the court coming back to get him.

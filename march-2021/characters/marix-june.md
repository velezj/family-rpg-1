# Summary Line

I'm going to win this game of life; you are merely a pawn.

# History

Marix's first memory is of the forest burning. He hears the screams of what he believes are his parents as gouts of flame fall all around. The trees fall then darkness. Marix was found and taken in by a band of brigands. Eventually, he learned they were responsible for the fire and the destruction of his home. He killed them all. Over the many years, Marix's hunt for revenge led him to develop more and darker magic; magic that binds and kills and erases from memory. To hone his skills, he took jobs; a killer for hire that was elusive and used magic to boot. His name, while not known to all, was feared in certain circles as the best, and coldest, of killers.

The brigands were not alone, Marix found out after torturing their leader. They were sent to fire the forest, but it was not their plan. Someone had ordered the strike, paid the brigands, and made sure no-one could stop the calamity from happening.

That someone took Marix's life from him. He often thinks about what his life with his family in the elven village would have been. He could have become a wise sage, or an archivist of elven lore. In his better moments he sees himself as having his own family. But four hundred years of hunting prey has ensured that these wishes become nothing but daydreams to pass the hours until another soul must be killed. He will find out why his family was killed. And h will kill them and all who were part of the plan. From the smallest urchin messenger boy to the leader of the scheme, their days are numbered. Every year he thinks of the new life possibly born by one of his targets. Every year he laughs as he thinks of the new lives he will take away.

# Appearance

Marix prefers the darker colors, blacks and grays, slimmed to show him lithe form but not flaunting his prowess. He keeps tab on fashion, and is always wearing something that is not the most current, but neither the oldest, of styles. His appearance is meant to be comfortable, normal, and completely bland so as to not stand out.

# Goals

- Find and kill everyone who destroyed his family and village

- Kill to keep himself honed and practiced

# Behavior

- Witty and charismatic, Marix behaves like a young courtier: poised, amicable, and having just enough intelligence to be of use.

- With easy smiles and a relaxed posture, Marix behaves quite civil and inoffensive. Endearing by his very inconsequential existence. This is, of course, a rouse.

# Hooks

- Marix will be looking for adventurers to "help clean up some monsters" that have started to ambush coaches traveling along the north of [Beggarsbottom](../places/beggarsbottom/story.md). In reality, he's looking for targets to practice his skills and keep himself honed. He will taken the adventurers down the road then ambush them and trap them in a dome. They will have to fight him to get out.

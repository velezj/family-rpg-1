# History

Vir was born in the wilds of the Fell Forest. She was found by a patrol and started living with the guards. Her quick mind and strong body did not go unnoticed. She was taught to be a spy from a small age. 

At age 10, she was given her first mission to kill a target. Faced with the target and finally understanding what she had been trained to do, Vir ran away. She lived in the dark alleys of the street. In order to survive she soon joined a group of merchants that could use her special skills. She became quite a celebrated smuggler. She never stayed in a city for long, moving from place to place and taking jobs as they came.

During her travels, she met and fell in love with Maya. Maya belong to the Sisters of the Sole, a convent that admired The Traveler. They met while Vir was on a job. Ever since that meeting, Vir remained working around Beggarsbottom where she could meet have chance meetings with Maya. Soon, Vir was a staple at the convent, always hauling in and out all manner of things. Her life as a smuggler fell to the background as she became more and more an honest merchant working for the sisters. 

However, her smuggling life would not be so easily dismissed. She was known as being the best smuggler around, and special missions requiring skills beyond the average smuggler were routed her way. While these opportunities were few and fart between, they were very lucrative. She spent most of the money earned this way helping the convent to fix and care for the facilities. 

Her last smuggling mission changed her life forever. The client needed perfect secrecy, and Vir provided it. A dozen crates, around Vir's height and not mush bigger that 2 feet on each side, needed to be moved. All went according to plan and Vir retrieved the crates. She was supposed to move them from one port to another, where a different vessel was waiting for them. When Vir arrived at the destination port, she saw the ship waiting for her. All seemed well, but then the guards arrived at the port. All of the crates were already on the ship so it cast away, turning and running towards the untamed ocean. 

The lead guardsman, a young noble just initiated into the troop, could not stand by and watch as the ship floated away. He sent a small fireball towards her sails. It was a perfect hit, the sails destroyed by the fire. But the ship was not manned properly. The fire spread to a set of crated loaded with alchemist's fire. The explosion broke the ship in two. Crates cracked, broke, and scattered all over the sea. A myriad of things, from jewels or fine wine bottles, spilled from the broken crates. But everyone's attention was fixated on those crates brought in by Vir. Bodies littered the ocean as the twelve crates broke and burned revealing their passengers. Whether dulled by poison or magic, each person burned without even trying to swim. Their screams would haunt all who were there. The guards dove into the water or commandeered boats. But it was too late. By the time they reached the bodies the alchemist fire had eaten away most of the flesh, the lungs and eyes burned away by the heat.

Vir dreams of this scene every night. As the crates fell away and the people burned Vir watches as the last of the crates gave way under the attack of the fire. There, on the water, floating and screaming yet not moving any other muscle was Maya. How? Why? Vir dove into the water and swam as fast as she could, passing by the guardsmen as she reached Maya. The fire, fueled by the potent liquid, crawled over Maya's entire body. Even those parts underwater burned with a malice that would forever scare Vir. Maya's screams had ended by the time Vir got to her body. Vir saw as, quicker that you would images, Maya turned into bones that slowly sank into the sea.

Maya was dead, and Vir was the one that took her to the slavers. Later, the young noble leading the guards was punished: stripped of his rank and booted out of his family. Vir tracked him down to a small hovel -- more a ditch -- near the outskirts of the city. His body was withered away, unkempt hair, patchy skin, and a smell that hovered over the entire area. He recognized Vir, their eyes meeting. Resigned to die, the man closed his eyes and Vir saw him sigh then smile. As much as she wanted to, Vir could not kill him. She was not a killer, not from the beginning and not now. She went and bought some food and drink, returning to the hovel. When she returned the man was dead, still smiling. His spirit broken, his last regret snuffed when he saw Vir's eyes, the man was ready for his next life to begin.

# Appearance

Muscular and toned, Vir would make most people shy away from him if she ever frowned. However, her smile comes easily and he puts most people at ease. Wearing very little in order to have the most flexibility, Vir enjoys feeling the air on his arms and torso. Her abs are the envy of everyone she meets.

# Goals

- Gain closure for Maya

- Redeem herself for her past as a smuggler.

# Behavior

- She has taught herself to twitch her tail when she lies as a first step towards redemption.

- She is always calm, observing and giving help freely.

- She is always attentive and has multiple plans at every moment. This is finely honed from her smuggling past.

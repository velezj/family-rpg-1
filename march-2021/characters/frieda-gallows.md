# Summary Line

Traumatized by her times with the fey [Elorin](elorin.md), Frieda always walks with one eye looking behind her for Fey, and the other eye looking ahead towards her newfound, and possibly dangerous, bond with [The Frozen One](../setting-world/celestials.md).

# History

Little is known about the Fey. The Fey inhabit the Wildwoods, leaving only to raid the lands. For what purpose, and what do they want, are a mystery.

Freida does not remember her life before the Fey. She knows that her village was raided, and all but she were slaughtered. However, a fey named [Elorin](elorin.md) took her is as a servant. She was expected to do whatever was asked of her, and she quickly realized that breaking expectations led to pain and suffering.  [Elorin](elorin.md) mostly had her do chores, and fed her truly delicious meals seemed to infuse her with power. 

All of that changed when [Elorin](elorin.md) was gravely injured in a Fey duel. Frieda took up most of the day-to-day goings of the [Elorin](elorin.md) household as her master recovered. However, she was never trained to hold banter and wit against the Fey of the other households. The house of [Elorin](elorin.md) crumbled into dishonor, going from a prominent house to a tale told to other Fey to become wary of humans and their ilk.

Frieda's life of misery began. [Elorin](elorin.md) lost touch with reality, refusing to believe his house had fallen so low. All the anger and hurt was focused in Frieda, and the Fey are quite good at coming up with ways to keep themselves entertained with humans.

One evening, Frieda was contacted by a being calling itself [The Frozen One](../setting-world/celestials.md). It promised power, power enough to leave the Fey. For months, Freida contemplated the promise and dangers of leaving. In the end, she could only decide what was best for herself. However, she left everything in order, with food and instructions for [Elorin](elorin.md), so that he could begin to take care of himself.

[The Frozen One's](../setting-world/celestials.md) contract was simple and suspicious. With a "I accept your power", sudden life and energy coursed through Freida. She left the Fey, walking away from the Wildwoods. When she finally saw the sun of humans lands she was confused: where was she?

Fearful of the Fey coming back to get her, and suspicious of this new power seemingly given for free, Freida began her journey through Kryta. Along the way, she realized that she had been with the Fey for 200 years!

Unknown to Frieda, the Fey raid was in fact targeting Sheem's previous incarnation at the time at the behest of the Demon Lord. Elorin wanted to raise a warrior and vanguard in case the demons broke their deal of having the Fey be a neutral party in the coming war.

# Appearance

As most gnomes, Freida's body is small and thin. Living with the Fey has given her strength and [The Frozen One's](../setting-world/celestials.md) power courses through her. However, such powers cannot be seen with the naked eye. She looks like a skinny gnome, weak and untrained.

Years spent with the Fey have given her a wealth of experiences few have ever had. She is extremely intelligent, and the Fey food has made her muscles tough and honed without causing them to get larger.

However, her eyes are constantly roaming her surroundings, ready for the Fey to attack of The Frozen One to show his true purpose for her destiny.

# Goals

- Integrate back into the human world

- Explore this new world

- Evade the Fey

- Investigate her connection to [The Frozen One](../setting-world/celestials.md)

# Behavior

- After years with the Fey, she cannot lie but can word-twit like the best of them

- She is always nervous, looking for attacks and the Fey everywhere

- She cannot sleep well, tortured by the games and shows the [Elorin](elorin.md) put her through near the end

- She has never had friends or a community, so she does not know how to behave with people or groups, causing her to be shy and introverted.

- when she is excited or scared, she will start chilling her skin and will be cooler than normal to the touch. If she stays in this state for more than 5 minutes, her breath will be chilled and will mist as condensation from the cold hits the air outside the body.

- Her tears are cold but not frozen

# Summary Line

I journey to experience other cultures and in doing so explore my self; the two will form a greater whole than apart. 

# History

Born in the depths of the Orgbolg mountains, Sahata felt an uncertain pressure inside since birth. Years of inner reflection an meditation revealed the pressure to be one of curiosity, of unending curiosity about the world beyond and a rigid conviction that together is stronger that alone. The cultures of others, their experiences and world; those can only make the soul stronger. With those thoughts, Sahata began a journey across the world, hoping to bridge and learn, teach and mold so that the entire world can come together in harmony.

- The codes and ethics are different than Sahata is used to. Sometimes combining multiple viewpoints is hard and bothersome and should be left for older, wiser people.

- Sahata will have never seen a druid (so [Owlex](owlex.md) or [Temo](temo.md)) and will be interested

# Summary Line

The weak perish, the strong will earn their place with the Demon Lord.

# History

Born to combat, Molvat has held a weapon in his hands since age 5. He was born in a mercenary camp, was raised in the camp, and fought with his camp. They were his family, and they were killed. Might as the power to be free was seared into his heart. Forged from this tragedy, Molvat trained, killed, betrayed, and stole, all to gain power. He found the killers, a pitiful company, and let them live; if his family was weak enough to be defeated by those grunts, then they deserved to die. News of the Demon Lord and his army caught his ear. There was a king who knew that power was everything. The strong survive and the weak perish. He started scouting other mercenaries, creating a grand company to offer up the the Demon Lord. 

# Appearance

Dark, from hair to skin to armor. The only contrast the yellow irises and sharp white teeth of a grinning maw.

# Goals

- Power

- Gain Prestige with Demon Lord

- Keep testing his limits

# Behavior

- Molvat goes straight for his goals. Anything in the way will be smashed aside

- Appearing jovial at first, not a single laugh reaches his eyes.

- While he may talk a lot, he never, ever, lets down his guard.

- Fighting dirty is winning. At the end, the one who's still alive is the strongest.

- He rides a Giant Alligator as a steed, armored, with steel spikes connected over the claws and tail for greater intimidation.

# Hooks

- Molvat has been sent with a small unit to gather and train the local monster population within the Canjok Forest. He and three men are whittling down the monsters into an elite force.

- Molvat will be interested in the sudden "awakening". He's smart enough to understand that if he could awaken his elite monsters they would be an even greater force to deal with.

- His units are training in the underground sewers, both to grab awakened flesh to study and to hone their skills at stealth etc. against the rats and other creatures of the sewers. The goblin units are the one that train, since they are the lowest units and a rat is a big thing for them.

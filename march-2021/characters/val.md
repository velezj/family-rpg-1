# Summary Line

Rough, loud, and loyal, Val is the reason why kids are asked to be "Peaceful *and* Quiet".

# History

# Appearance

A small rabbit with a large hammer on it's back, Val strikes you initially as a barbarian. The second impression does not change this impression. However, he *does* wear the robes of Dia and the Peace Domain.... so maybe he's a priest ... a war priest of the peace domain .... do those exist? ....

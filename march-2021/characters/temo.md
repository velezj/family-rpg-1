# Summary Line

Life, death, a circle unbroken. Those who oppose must be brought back into the natural flow.

# History

From the egg, Temo was fated to imbue nature and the cycles. The sacred circle of the tribe was gifted onto Temo. The protection and maintenance was the very essence from 14 years of age. The monsters came, the others fell to claw and horrors. The circle, broken and apart, back to the dirt it started as. Duty done, but the cycles are formed always and everywhere. The natural flow must be kept and those who try to break the cycle must be brought back into harmony with nature.

# Appearance

- Surrounded by a cloud of spores

- Appearance is not important, but hoods and cloaks help with the weather.

# Goals

- Temo has sensed the miasma and the awakening. Out in the world, strength, numbers, harmony must gather to return those awake back into the cycles of sleep.

- Emotions are distant and fleeting, but understanding of them makes companions. Stronger the flow the stronger the harmony it can bring

# Behavior

- An evil has awakened and must be stopped, fought, understood and found. To do this requires working with all creatures, those who think like me and those who do not. I am searching for allies.

- Looking inward is the answer to all questions. The cycle inside, the Cycle outside: one and the same, to look inwards is to know all.

# Hooks

- Will sense/learn about [Marksfield](../places/marksfield/story.md) liquid

- Will sense the awakened heart

- Will try to stop [Danfir Rootbreaker](danfir-rootbreaker.md)

- Looking for companions to fight the heart

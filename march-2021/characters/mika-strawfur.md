There was not enough for everyone. Being the eldest, the most responsible and the person most filled with a sense of right and good, Mika decided to leave and live on her own. She chose the path of the adventurer, having some small connection to the [Celestials](../setting-world/celestials.md). She always sends funds to her family to help the farm out.

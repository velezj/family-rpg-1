# Summary Line

Tasked to wander the world destroying perversions, Sheem looks to The Frozen One as guide and mentor.

# History

Sheem is a reincarnated soul. Born a few centuries before [The Fall](../setting-world/world.md), Sheem witnessed the devastation and aberrations resulting from [Jantrea's](../setting-world/celestials.md) departure. Sheem was a [Guiding Arrow](), part of an order that connected with [Jantrea](../setting-world/celestials.d) in the deepest of levels. Not just a member, Sheem was the current leader of the [Guiding Arrows](). Being the closest to [Jantrea](../setting-world/celestials.md), the [Guiding Arrows]() were decimated by the backlash from [Jantrea's](../setting-world/celestials.md) departure. Only Sheem survived unscathed. The rest of the [Guiding Arrows]() became what are now knows as [Demons](../setting-world/demons.md).

Alone, rejected by the world as a bringer of evil and wrecked by the pain of having what was Sheem's family become the [Demons](../setting-world/demons.md) of nightmares, Sheem distanced themselves from the world. Wandering for centuries across the new world, witnessing the result of [Jantrea's](../setting-world/celestials.md) leave, Sheems devotion and admiration dwindled. With time came wisdom, and Sheem came to think of [Jantrea's](../setting-world/celestials.md) strict mandates and law as a cautionary tale of the brittleness and inflexibility of the rigid morality imposed, even inflicted onto, the races by [Jantrea](../setting-world/celestials.md). 

During the later part of their life, Sheem's thoughts turned to atonement. But it was too much of a single person to take on the responsibility of [The Fall](../setting-world/world.md). Unless, that is, if the person could have nearly infinite time. [The Frozen One](../setting-world/celestials.md) and Sheem found each other, both looking for a solution to [Jantrea's](../setting-world/celestials.md) departure. They agreed to have Sheem lead a new group dedicated to handling the result of [Jantrea's](../setting-world/celestials.md) departure: the [Glittering Ones](../setting-world/the-froze-one.md). 

Sheem pledge his life to the [Frozen One](../setting-world/the-froze-one.md) and to handling the remains of [Jantrea](../setting-world/celestials.md). [The Frozen One](../setting-world/the-froze-one.md) accepted the pledge and caused Sheem's soul to reincarnate into a new body upon mortal death until the job was done.

Sheem leads the [Glittering Ones](../setting-world/the-froze-one.md) to this day and is one of the most active members, preferring to live and fight within the world rather than leading from afar.

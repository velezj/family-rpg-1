# Summary Line

Tasked to wander the world destroying perversions, Sheem looks to The Frozen One as guide and mentor.

# History

Sheem is a reincarnated soul. Born a few centuries before [The Fall](../setting-world/world.md), Sheem witnessed the devastation and aberrations resulting from [Jantrea's](../setting-world/celestials.md) departure. Sheem was a [Guiding Arrow](), part of an order that connected with [Jantrea](../setting-world/celestials.md) in the deepest of levels. Not just a member, Sheem was the current leader of the [Guiding Arrows](). Being the closest to [Jantrea](../setting-world/celestials.md), the [Guiding Arrows]() were decimated by the backlash from [Jantrea's](../setting-world/celestials.md) departure. Only Sheem survived unscathed. The rest of the [Guiding Arrows]() became what are now knows as [Demons](../setting-world/demons.md).

Alone, rejected by the world as a bringer of evil and wrecked by the pain of having what was Sheem's family become the [Demons](../setting-world/demons.md) of nightmares, Sheem distanced themselves from the world. Wandering for centuries across the new world, witnessing the result of [Jantrea's](../setting-world/celestials.md) leave, Sheems devotion and admiration dwindled. With time came wisdom, and Sheem came to think of [Jantrea's](../setting-world/celestials.md) strict mandates and law as a cautionary tale of the brittleness and inflexibility of the rigid morality imposed, even inflicted onto, the races by [Jantrea](../setting-world/celestials.md). 

During the later part of their life, Sheem's thoughts turned to atonement. But it was too much of a single person to take on the responsibility of [The Fall](../setting-world/world.md). Unless, that is, if the person could have nearly infinite time. [The Frozen One](../setting-world/the-frozen-one.md) and Sheem found each other, both looking for a solution to [Jantrea's](../setting-world/celestials.md) departure. They agreed to have Sheem lead a new group dedicated to handling the result of [Jantrea's](../setting-world/celestials.md) departure: the [Glittering Ones](../setting-world/the-frozen-one.md). 

Sheem pledge his life to the [Frozen One](../setting-world/the-frozen-one.md) and to handling the remains of [Jantrea](../setting-world/celestials.md). [The Frozen One](../setting-world/the-frozen-one.md) accepted the pledge and caused Sheem's soul to reincarnate into a new body upon mortal death until the job was done.

Sheem leads the [Glittering Ones](../setting-world/the-frozen-one.md) to this day and is one of the most active members, preferring to live and fight within the world rather than leading from afar.


476 years ago, his previous incarnation was destroyed in a Fey raid. This was, unbeknownst to him, orchestrated by the Demon Lord in order to have him out of the way (basically a baby) while the demons weakened the seal holding The Outsider.

title: Arrive at Fir (1)
---

When the party arrives at [Fir]() they see a small set of buildings surrounding a large tree with a well nestled nearby for travelers and town-folks. They can find rooms at the single tavern -- the largest building in the town. 

If you decide to ask around about rumors or check the atmosphere, you will find the town slightly at edge. It seems like there have been an increase in goblin sightings, including hobgoblins which are relatively rare. There is also a rumor of a great magical beast with metal claws and razor teeth than can eat an elk whole.

Nothing much happens at the town.

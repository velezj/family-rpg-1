# Summary

While sleeping, Gustavo, Owlex, and Mary are pulled into a joint dream where the shadows of The Outsider's minions lurk and search from them.

# Narrative

A few hours pass as you sleep in a real bed again. You can feel some of the weariness of travel slowly melting away. When heading to bed you were hesitant, this being the first time you have been in a completely new place; one that is not surrounded by family or kin. This is it, this is where you finally come to terms with what your decision to travel, to live, and to experience things outside of your familiar village. Without a doubt, you realize the your journey has truly, really, begun. You are now part of a group -- and adventurer's group -- in a completely new house that, for now, is your home, sleeping in a room atop magical stoves and an exhausted, and hurt, adventurer. You have no idea what will happen next, or who you will meet, and you can't wait for tomorrow, for the possibilities that are in front of you now that you could not have imagined before. The stories you have heard, the tales of magic, monsters, heroes and villains now seem a bit more daunting as you, yourselves, realize how strange those stories are. Events that are fantastical and amazing, those pieces of stories that moved you heart and children huddled near the story teller now seem a bit more ... realistic. After all, you *have* met a Fey, and not only that but somehow received a mysterious mark from them. You've encountered an Anthropologist whose study of cultures have led him to travel across the land. Oh, and the anthropologist can somehow travel to different planes and is a bipedal humanoid turtle. You've met a wounded adventurer that carries wounds beyond those you can see, and you have become apprenticed to an old gnome who seems to love reading romantic comedies.

As the night continues, both of you open your eyes, awake. Strangely you can clearly see your room even though night has fallen and the forest is dark. A faint smell of berries wafts across the room and as you follow the scent to its source you see a white fog is seeping in from underneath the door. Somehow the room fills with the fog, much quicker, much denser that it should have. You can no longer even see the door and the walls, the room, even the beds you are on are swallowed into the fog. You feel a sudden shift in gravity that makes your stomach tumble a bit, and where once you were laying down you are now standing up on some surface. The fog thins a bit around you revealing Mary standing next to you, staring around her, as confused as you are. Maybe even more so, for when she looks down she's startled by her right arm, which should not have been there. A translucent, golden, arm is now attached to her. A symbol is faintly glowing on the arm and you see more and more of the fog billowing out from the symbol. Ignoring reality, the fog thickens as it stream of her arm seems to wrap around the three of you, getting thicker and denser the farther away. 

Gustavo. Looking towards Owlex she is also staring at her right arm. Surrounding her perfectly normal arm you see the faint outline of a massive paw ending in sharp-looking claws where her fingers are. As she moves her arm the paw follows responding just as if she were moving it. It is definitely strange, so you call out to Owlex, a cell she completely ignores. Even though you know that called out to her, you don't hear your own voice. In fact, you hear no sounds at all. You keep shifting you view between Mary and Owlex as they both look at their new additions. Finally, Mary looks up with a shrug and sees the two of you. She points at you, Gustavo and tries to tell you something. However, once again you hear nothing. No, actually, she seem to be pointing *behind* you. You turn around and see Sam on her knees holding her head and shaking back and forth. 

You attempt to walk towards her, and you do. She sees you when you get close and quickly stands up and grabs you by your shoulders. Sam starts shaking you back and forth. You can tell she's probably yelling something at you as tear fall from her eyes. If you had to guess, she seems more confused and scared rather then hurt or angry as she continues to shake you. Mary and Owlex appear next to you and place a hand on Sam's shoulder. Sam finally seems to calm down, letting you go Gustavo, and takes some deep breaths before giving you a small nod.

Just as the four of you start to look around once again, Mary begins to point towards something when you see a bright red gash appear on her arm, her left arm. You can just make out a darker part of the mist that moves away from her arm, disappearing back into the dense fog beyond your immediate space.

# After Battle Narrative

The mist continues to leak from the symbol on Mary's arm and thickens around your group, somehow letting you see each other but blocking anything farther than 5 feet away from your group. All is silent.

<a few minutes of interactions/waiting>

You begging to see a blue glow from within the mist. It's getting brighter and moving, back and forth, back and forth. As the glow brightens, you see the shadow of something long and thin moving through the mist, twisting and turning, moving closer and farther taking the blue glow with it. You realize the twisting rope-like thing is the cause of the glow as it swerves nearer to your location. The mist seems to swirl in it's wake and begins to recede in front of the object. 

< what do players do, the rope will be searching>
	
As the glowing object gets closer, you get a better grasp of it's appearance. It looks like a tightly wound rope make of infinite crystal shards that soundlessly roll and flex without breaking. Each shard is shaped like a drop of water and emits a blue, pulsing light; together the shards engulf the rope in the bright glow you see. The shards simply stop at both ends of the rope and you can see circle patterns of twisted and corded shards deeper and deeper inside the rope, as tightly coiled and wound as any rope you have ever seen. The rope moves through the space as if searching for something. The mist gives way before the rope so that a small area of clear space, around 10 feet, surrounds the rope.
	
< what do players do>


Closer and closer the rope wanders towards the party until you sense it focus on you. Thin beams of light shine onto the four of you, landing on the Fey blood-pact mark on your fingers. With a bright flash, one end of the rope splits into four thinner strands each of which head directly towards your party. 

< what do players do>

The strands slowly wrap around your hands, starting from the finger. Gustavo, as you feel the rope twine around you it somehow feels ... familiar. You can sense that the rope is somehow made of magic or wrapped with magic. Your own magic seems to resonate with it and you hear dim whispers. "Apprentice" "Apprentice" "Come Back" "bound" "Come Back" "Summer's sign". They seem to echo and repeat around and around. When you focus on the voice it turns into a steady chant and you feel the rope grab hold harder, firmer. The other end of the rope dives down into the ground and a dark blue hole opens up with the rope leading into it. It begins to pull all of you into the thick mist, the chanting getting louder and more distinct. Slowly the party's hands and torso get pulled into the whole, but as Sam's arm reaches the hole you see her face distort in agony. While your arms went into the blue void seamlessly, Sam's hand seem to be unable to enter and yet the rope is still pulling her arm. You see something like a double image, almost as if a sticker with Sam's shape is being peeled off and pulled into the hole while Sam herself is unmoved but clearly in pain. 

< what does party do>


## Sam's Body and Spirit

In order to Sam's spirit and body to not be sundered her spirit (in the mist) must be connected to her body (around the forest of Fir). This connection requires a magical focus or power to connect them.

- Gustavo uses his magic to try to "communicate" with Garth and tell him about Sam. Garth can then change his magic to bring *both* her spirit and body together.

- Owlex can touch Sam and, trough he nature spirit power, find and connect her spirit to her body, splitting the rope further and attaching it to the body

- Anyone can try to use their magic to bind her body's Fay blood-pact mark to her spirit mark and both body and soul would be pulled.

- Mary can touch Sam with her shining arm and let her spirit share Mary's body, living in her arm, therefore bringing back Sam's spirit.


If nothing is done, Sam will be split into:
- Her body (around Fir)
- Her Shadow (in the mist)
- Her Spirit. this will be brought back (the peeled sticker part). She will appear as a ghost or apparition

# Brought Back

As the rest of you party goes into the hole, pulled by the rope of shards, you are enveloped by darkness. At some point, you must have closed you eyes, because you open them. Kneeling over Gustavo is Garth. A very scary Garth. His eyes have turned milky white and you can see flickers of red and yellow lightning within his iris. His beard cackles with energy and little lightning bolts zap up and down his hair striking the ground around him. The grass within 10 feet of Garth is gray and made of ash. Bits of wind from the lightning strikes blow away the likeness of grass into puffs of gray. Garth is holding onto your hand and has looped a red thread around the two writs. You also see a small pin stabbing his finger and yours centered on the Fey mark. Drops of blood are flowing unnaturally from Garth's wound onto the red thread and you realize the thread was originally white. Garth continues the chanting that you hear in the mist, but now you can hear it fully: "Come back Apprentice, I call you by magic's thread. Come back Gustavo, I call you by Summer's sign. Come back Gustavo, I call you by Winter's crest."

Mary and Owlex are next to you, slowly waking up. Somehow, you are outside at the bottom of the hill the Other Guild is on. You see a faint dome surrounding the building, with you at the very edge of the dome but still inside. You can see small cracks of white that quickly get healed illuminating the night as the dome seems to flicker in and out of your vision.

< narrative description of Sam as either spirit, or her body being on the *other* side of the barrier (hence outside of the bubble). >

The chant stops and Garth slowly falls to the ground, eyes still open. The blood is still dripping from the pin onto the string tying Garth to Gustavo. The bolts of lightning have stopped and the sounds of a gentle night resume. The translucent dome still flickers her and there and you can see massive undulations wax and wane across surface, distorting the perfect dome before the shape once again reconstructs itself. 

< What do players do>

**Actions taken by Mary**
- Mary will eventually realize that Garth needs help from a wizard
  - She will think of two possibilities:
	- Rosaline, magic researcher and wizard
	- Bailor Trekling, head of Sisters of the Sole
  - both are roughly the same distance, Rosaline might be a bit closer
  - She will debate  whether:
	- to go herself to get help
	- to send Gustavo/Owlex
	- To get help from both
	- to take Garth with her and get help
	
**Sam**
- Sam as a spirit will be in shock from having her spirit yanked back without a body
- Sam (real body) will act confused about what is going on
- She will notice Garth's condition and will try to help him by:
  - she will look around for wild herbs that can help
  - she will inspect the pin wound
  - she will volunteer to go get help (as a spirit also)
- She will ask Owlex to cast cure-wounds on Garth, but it has very little effect.

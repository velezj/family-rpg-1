# Summary

Deeper in the sewers you find a pair of rat-folk, [Kusoto Mari](../characters/kusoto-mari.md) and [Mika Strawfur](../characters/mika-strawfur.md), fighting grubs. They would like to join you for safety.

# Narrative Details

As you get deeper into the sewers you hear a faint sound of metal against stone. You approach and soon recognize the sound as someone fighting. You are near enough that you also hear someone chanting or praying as well as wet thuds. 

(on perception check) you recognize the sounds as a sword cutting into the grubs you have encountered.

When the pair hear you coming, one of the rat-folk (named [Kusoto](../characters/kusoto-mari.md) ) will speak. "Who's there ... show yourself!" Ask we ducks away from the grub in front of him with a flourish and strikes down his sword into it's mouth. With a last twinge, the grub falls limp.  You see a female rat-folk (named [Mika](../characters/mika-strawfur.md) ) slump to the ground on her knees, exhaustion evident across her face. The male rat-folk turns to you with his sword drawn and takes a good look at your clothes and bearing. "You there ... I see you come from the [Cairston](../places/cairston.md) side of the sewers ... Have you come across any of this filth?" he says while kicking the grub's body. From behind him you see the female rat-folk give a heaving cough and sway slightly. At this the male rat-folk quickly back-walks to her. "Mika, Mika ... what's wrong?"

She looks up gingerly turns to show the right side of her robes.

(If perception or Nature check) You notice a splosh that's darker than the sewage and realize one of the grubs must have taken a byte out of her.

You see as she starts breathing heavily then slumps onto the floor, unconscious. "Mika, Mika..." the male slaps her, gently and then harder, hoping to wake her up, but she stays still. He looks at the party. You can see that he is trying to stay calm, but his eyes are pleading for help, for someone to get them out there and help his companion. "She needs healing ... medical attention ... anything ... we were already tired when these grubs came upon us and I fear that she stretched herself too far" He takes a breath and stands up, looking at each of you directly into your eyes in turn. "I would ask that you help me, help save my companion. The sewers are dangerous now and I fear I alone cannot handle caring for Mika and defeating any more of these horrid worms." He steps down onto one knee and places his sword down in front of him perpendicular to his body. "I, Kusoto Mari, humbly ask for you help to save my companion Mika Strawfur. We would be in your debt. Please, help me take Mika to a healer."

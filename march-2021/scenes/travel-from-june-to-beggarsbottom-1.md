# Events

- You will notice [Mary](../characters/mary-tanner.md) turn slightly melancholy and quieter as you get closer to [Beggarsbottom](../places/beggarsbottom/story.md).

- You will not see anyone else on the road, which is not typical according to [Mary](../characters/mary-tanner.md)

# Narrative

You continue to travel over rolling hills and grasslands. Given that it is a pleasant day, you are surprised to see no one else on the road. Every once in a while you pass by a farm where you see some farmhands getting ready for the fall harvest. You can feel their stares as they follow your party with their eyes. They seem to be on their guard and you notice some of the farmers even have bows slung over the shoulder. Further down the road you see several vultures circling nearby towards the east. Straining your eyes you can just make out a lump on the ground several hundred feet from the road. { With a perception DC 15, you can see that resembles a humanoid torso within the pile. }

_if they get closer to investigate_:
- As you get closer you see half of a human torso on the ground with wounds all over their body. The lower half, however, looks like a mixture of a human and a bid, with the feet actually being talons with sharp-looking claws. "Careful ... Harpys are ferocious when cornered. And whatever you do, do not listen to their song," warns Mary. Waving away the vultures, you check the body. You find many small lacerations covering the whole body. 

{ Investigation DC 20 or Nature DC 20 }: The wounds are consistent with talon slashes. You find several large white feathers that do not belong to the Harpy. They are too big to be eagle or hawk feathers. Given the size of the feathers and the claw marks the attacker was a large eagle-like creature. However, not a single bite mark can be seen and the whole Harpy and no meat is missing. This was definitely the work of a monster that was killing for some other reason that hunger and sustenance. Mary: "Hmm. Around these parts the only things that has talons that big and feathers are Griffons. Mean lion-birds that are extremely territorial. Although I've never really seen a single Harpy by itself. They usually flock prey and take them down with numbers not strength." Mary looks down in thought. "A lone Harpy and at least one Griffon fighting this close to the road. The Harpys usually nest near the coast, and no farm would let a Griffon roam around without calling for some adventurers to hunt it down. Just what is going on around here. There's just too many monsters."

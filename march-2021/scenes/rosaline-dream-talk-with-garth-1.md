title: Rosaline and Garth Dream Talk
---

# Summary

Rosaline is in a coma after attempting to analyze the black scar of Mary. Garth will try to contact her in her dreams and will succeed. Rosaline will tell him about the following.

# Narrative

As she was analyzing the scar, she felt a strong will wash over here and try to grab and pull her somewhere. The will was coarse and seemed in turmoil and discord ... and maybe even pain. It was trying to overcome my own will with brute force, and it was winning. As a defense, I delved inward into the deepest parts of my mind. This seemed to have confused it for a bit. However, even now I can still sense this will searching for me. Thankfully I have trained my mind and am defending and confusing it as it searching inside me. However, I do not think I am strong enough to face it alone and win. I am confident that I can keep it from finding me here for some time. 

She looks at Garth. The only way I know to beat this thing is to get help fighting it. I know it is dangerous, melding the minds of others with mine. But right now it is inside my mind and therefore that is where we must drive it out. However ... I do not think you and I will be enough Garth. It's power is immense, primitive ... almost feral in pursuit of prey. I have never encountered a will as strong ... and as troubled ... and this. 

# Options

- the more Rosaline knows someone, the easier it is to join in her mind and the less likely they are to damage parts of her mind while in there.

- With the help of Umrik, Garth, and Baylor it *might* be enough


# Umrik

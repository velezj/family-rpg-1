When gustavo begins to open hte book, the old and beated leathery cover comes off the book with a small snapping sound. It then starts to wither and vanishes into a thin vapor and is gone. You smell a subtle gentle fragrance. Somewhat like nutty ... similar to the smell of fresh coffe but much more subdued and relaxing. You can just barely smell it and then the fragrance is gone. You feel the book get warm in your hands and as you look down you notice that the skin that is touching the book is strentching. the skin of your hand is creeping over the book. not at all painful. you can't even feel your sking moving and tretching and almost seeming to devour the book. Your hands and captured tight. You can't move them, or your body for that matter. Eventually, the whole book is covered by a layer of your skin. Silently, the streched skin tears from your hands and you drop hte book. Your hands seem perfectly normal, the skin just like it was before. The book now has a new cover, made from the skin that slowly surrounded it. You see a glow beneath the cover comming from inside the book, then you feel a small tremmor, mor like a spike of pressure and earth rippling underneath your feet. All is quiet and you feel your body released from whatever was holding it in place. When you open the book, the first page now has the following title written on it: 

Herein lies the journal of Jon-Yo, the chosen projection of Erutrea's will. 

You see a number of signatures under this line. Many signatures. For pages. Eventually you come to a page with only a single bit of writing centered on it:

Good [evening/morning/afternoon]. I believe introductions are in order. I am referred to as "The Book" and will be your chronicler and guide in accordance with the wishes of Erutrea whom I serve. And you are Gustavo from Jacksonville. It has been my experience that you will need some time to adjust to your new role as a projection of Erutrea with me as your guide, therefore I will keep this, our first meeting, brief: Welcome, and understand two things. First, Erutrea chose you, not me. And Second, I can sever our bond at any time.

Signed at the bottom: Duteously, The Book.

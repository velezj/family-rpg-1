title: Herb Collection Guard around Fir
---

The party agrees to guard a [Fir](../places/fir.md) local herbalist gather some much needed herbs. If asked, they will tell you that the herbs they are going to collect are those that grow deeper in the woods, hence they wanted an extra guard and protection with them. The herbalist will ask [Mary](../characters/mary-tanner.md) but can be convinced to hire all three party members.

The party sets out into the forest, following the herbalist. Every once in a while the herbalist will stop and study the side of a tree or rock, or they might grab a handful of soil and smell the sweet scent, for what is anyone's guess. No-one in the party is trained enough to figure out why.

After and hour or so, the herbalist looks back, "The forest is quiet today." He looks around overhead and around the canopy. Mary will stop and gesture to the rest to stop. With only their breath to accompany the woods, it really does seem quiet. "Is it usually so calm?" asks [Mary](../characters/mary-tanner.md).

"It has been several month since I've been to this region of the forest. The herbs are rare and so I gather as many as I can, when I can, and extract very bit of essence from them. But no. The last time I came the forest was full of bird calls and the clatter of small paws hurrying about their day. .... but this is not the most familiar part of the forest to me .... few venture this far. There is nothing of worth this direction, only trees and woods until you reach the [Grendil Steepes](../places/grendil-steepes.md)."

As you continue deeper, now searching for sounds of animals, you do get a few pieces of birdsong or the scurry of feet burrowing into the ground. About two hours into your journey the herbalist pulls up a clump of grass and smile "Ah yes, here we are. We're almost there, an hour at most." He keeps walking with a determined stride now that the goal is near. [The Wolves](encounters/herb-wolves.md) sense the party and start tracking them for the next 10 minutes, finally attacking.

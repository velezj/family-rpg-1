title: Herb Collection Guard around Fir
---

The party agrees to guard a [Fir](../places/fir.md) local herbalist gather some much needed herbs. If asked, they will tell you that the herbs they are going to collect are those that grow deeper in the woods, hence they wanted an extra guard and protection with them. The herbalist will ask [Mary](../characters/mary-tanner.md) but can be convinced to hire all three party members.

# The Wolves

The party sets out into the forest, following the herbalist. Every once in a while the herbalist will stop and study the side of a tree or rock, or they might grab a handful of soil and smell the sweet scent, for what is anyone's guess. No-one in the party is trained enough to figure out why.

After and hour or so, the herbalist looks back, "The forest is quiet today." He looks around overhead and around the canopy. Mary will stop and gesture to the rest to stop. With only their breath to accompany the woods, it really does seem quiet. "Is it usually so calm?" asks [Mary](../characters/mary-tanner.md).

"It has been several month since I've been to this region of the forest. The herbs are rare and so I gather as many as I can, when I can, and extract very bit of essence from them. But no. The last time I came the forest was full of bird calls and the clatter of small paws hurrying about their day. .... but this is not the most familiar part of the forest to me .... few venture this far. There is nothing of worth this direction, only trees and woods until you reach the [Grendil Steepes](../places/grendil-steepes.md)."

As you continue deeper, now searching for sounds of animals, you do get a few pieces of birdsong or the scurry of feet burrowing into the ground. About two hours into your journey the herbalist pulls up a clump of grass and smile "Ah yes, here we are. We're almost there, an hour at most." He keeps walking with a determined stride now that the goal is near. [The Wolves](encounters/herb-wolves.md) sense the party and start tracking them for the next 10 minutes, finally attacking.

# Mary's exhaustion

After the battle with the wolves, [Mary](../characters/mary-tanner.md) will slump to the ground exhausted. Your can see that she's sweating profusely and her skin has become a little pale except for the scar on her neck. If asked, she will say she is just tired from the journey and will deflect all questions of worries about her health. She'll want to rest for about half an hour. During the rest, Sam will make some tea for the party that is meant to strengthen the constitution; [Tea of Vitality](../items/tea-of-vitality.md). Sam will gladly accept help lighting the fire from either PC (both have campfire capabilities).

During the rest, [Mary](../characters/mary-tanner.md) will also give some combat pointers to the party since this is the first time they are fighting together and she's the only one with experience.
"Gustavo, you're a magic user hugh? That fire magic back there was you right?" ... "Since were working together, let talk about our group and how we best work with each other, fair?" "Almost all of the magic users I know fight from the back of the group. They're not usually trying to hit things with a stick, and they also like to be able to concentrate on their spells without having monsters try to bite them." Mary closes her eyes a bit and lays down on the ground. "And you Owlex, that was nice work with the spear. But you're armor is thinner than mine, so how about you wait until all of the monsters are concentrating on me and then you come in from behind or the sides to hit them. That way, the monsters have to worry about their backs and will be easier to hit."

Soon enough she'll stand up, "It's time to gather some herbs" she says as she begins walking. As the party continues, it will be at a slower pace because of [Mary's](../characters/mary-tanner.md) state.


# The herb patches

Sam checks the earth and looks up at the trees, "Ok, this is the place". "Now it's my time to shine" she pumps her fist a little as she starts searching about the forest. If asked, she'll explain that the two herbs are rare and usually grow in small pockets of the forest. One is pink in color and only grows near a [Star Twinkle](#star-twinkle-tree) tree. The second herb is a darker violet or deep ruby color with fern-like clusters of flowers low to the ground.

## Star Twinkle Tree

An uncommon tree that attracts the essence of magic near it as it grows. Only places with some form of magical energy, however small, can even support Star Twinkle trees. They are easy to spot, as they are covered in light motes that twinkle as you look and are usually very colorful and bright compared to the natural earth tones of most plants. The grow rate of a Star Twinkle tree is related to the amount of magic consumed and so has nothing to do with time. This makes it extremely hard to age a particular tree.


# The goblin group

Because of the slow down due to [Mary's](../characters/mary-tanner.md) fatigue the party will not get the [Fir](../places/fir.md) until well after dark. During their walk, the party will hear the sounds of some creatures moving in the forest. With a nature or survival check of DC 13 they realize the sound is that of a cart moving through the forest. If they decide to investigate they will come across the goblin group that is headed to their cave with carts. There are a total of 6 goblins pulling 2 carts. The goblins are pulling carts that seem pretty heavy for them. There are three goblins to a cart and you can see each of them is putting in effort to roll the cart forward on the rough forest ground. Every few minutes one of the goblins will bump into another one and they will growl at each other and gnash their teeth, but then they'll look at the bugbear and continue pulling the cart. The goblins are not trying to be stealthy and look mostly tired and bored. They are not really looking out for any dangers in the forest. The Bugbear will be looking around and keeping an eye out for dangers and surprises in the forest. More importantly, every few minutes the Bugbear will go to the back of the cart and try to erase the trail of their passage. He waves what looks to be a small, flat stone over and around the tracks and you see a faint shimmer as their trail seems to disappear. The stone goes back into one of the bugbear's packs.

The bugbear is carrying a [Stone of Dusting](../items/stone-of-dusting.md) to cover their tracks.

# The goblin cave

Inside the goblin cave a small outpost is being made by the goblins. In one corner of the cave you see a Worg training area. Another corner consists of a group of Bugbears which are camping away from the normal goblins. At the far back of the cave you see a slightly fancier tent where the Orc commander of this group sits.

# Camping Out

With the slower speed because of exhaustion (and possibly following the goblins), the party will have to camp outside at night. If they try to keep going, it will be even slower since not all of them have darkvision, Sam is not great at walking in the night, and [Mary](../characters/mary-tanner.md) will collapse from exhaustion. During the napping Mary will deflect any question about her health by saying she has traveled quite far in the past two weeks and is just ready to get back to Beggarsbottom. She will drink a vial of liquid during the night (DC 13 to see) to help her (a healing potion of some sort but not a magical one). The potion is actually used to continue her illusion effects even while sleeping. Mary will bring up the idea of going to Beggarsbottom with her since they seemed to work together well. She will also as Sam about Fir and how it is doing.

Mary:
"You know, you've got some promise kids. I can tell you're a magic user Gustavo. Although .... that spell you did back there .... was it supposed to be Firebolt?" ... "Because it looked a little strange to me ... most of the Firebolts I've seen are these small pebble sized quick missile ... you're was a bit ... amorphous and kind of curved as it flew ..." Mary will take her metal fork and stab it into hte ground where there is mostly dirt. "How about you practice trying to hit this to see how your aim is." She turns to look at Owlex. "Not too bad with the spear

"Things have been getting a little more dangerous lately," says Sam. "There are fewer creatures in the forest, which means the hunters have to go farther into the woods and some have not come back. There's alos talk of the Demon Lord rising up north and so a lot of our young ones have the twinkle of wanderlust in their eyes. Other than once-in-a-while jobs, hunting' the only thing people do in Fir. Sometimes we collect forest resources, but Juneston has just as many trees around but is closer to Beggarsbottom, so we don't get much trace up here for goods except for meat." she glances down, "I'm the only herbalist around these woods, so you'd think people would be breaking down my door to by potions and teas. but the people here in the frontier are tough stubborn folk. They just grit their teeth and work through the pain." Mary gives a small chuckle at this.

"I used to be like that too. Somehow potions felt like cheating, like telling the world you just weren't strong enough" She sips her tea, "Now I know that was just my idiotic youth talking. There's nothing like some soothing tea and a green stamina potion after the end of a fight." She looks over at the PCs then winks at Sam. "I've even gotten to like that astringent, biting taste you herbalists like so much"

"It's not like we can afford to waste sugar and spices on potions you know. It's the herbs themselves that taste so strong. Would you pay 2 to 3 times as much for a potion that tastes better? I don't think so. It is wasn't for the kingdom keeping potion sales steady and forcing prices to be the same throughout the kingdom, you might not even be able to afford a stamina potion after a fight! Those things take a long time to make .... and the smell is even worse than the taste!" At that you see Sams face turn a little pale as she remembers the smell. "I had to work outside for an  entire week while my store went back to smelling just horrid instead of insufferable."

# Back to Fir with information

When you get back to [Fir](../places/fir.md) Sam will want to report what you saw about the goblins to the mayor. [Mary](../characters/mary-tanner.md) will also report the starved wolves and the lack of sounds and creatures in the forest. The mayor will tell the party that the forest has been dangerous of late. More than a few travelers have not come back after paying for rooms at the tavern. One scared couple even ran back to town yelling something about Goblin in the forest. But they've never come down this far from the mountains. The couple probably saw a large frog and through it was a goblin or something. 

Once the conversation with the mayor finishes, Sam will go to her shop and pay the party. Depending on the quality of the herbs gathered she may throw in some extra salves or tea and may pay more as a bonus for the unexpected fights. Sam will also introduce the party to the tanner if there are wolf pelts they want to sell.

If the quickling is killed or brought back and the mayor is told, he will tell you to keep it hidden. In [Fir](../places/fir.md) people are superstitious and messing with the [Fey](../setting-world/fey.md) is a bad omen.

# Heading to Beggarsbottom

The next town in the road is [Juneston](../places/juneston.md). [Mary](../characters/mary-tanner.md) will want to continue traveling with the party. If the party decides to stay an extra day or two in [Fir](../places/fir.md) she will wait with them, otherwise she will keep going and tells them to look her up in [Beggarsbottom](../places/beggarsbottom/story.md) when they get there. She will tell her to ask around for the adventurer [Mary](../characters/mary-tanner.md).

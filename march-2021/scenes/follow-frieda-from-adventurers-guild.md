# Frieda's Character

- Scared about Fey 
- Nervous
- Uncomfortable in social settings
- Most of the world, and "common sense" is completely missing for "fey common sense"

# Looking for Frieda

After the conversation, you remember the strange gnome who seemed to pay attention to your party. You can check the last location you saw them and try to find them in town.

Depending on the strategy you use to find them, you will make a roll to see how well you are.

| Strategy             | Roll          | Notes                                  | DC |
|----------------------|---------------|----------------------------------------|----|
| Ask around town      | Investigation | Advantage if Mary helps, get info also | 13 |
| Walk and look around | Perception    |                                        | 20 |
|                      |               |                                        |    |

On a success, you will see Frieda. She will also see you unless you try to sneak (stealth DC 19).

# Chase

If the party tries to follow Frieda, we will be in a *chase*. 

- Frieda will not really know Beggarsbottom too well, so she will try to run outside of town. There, her height will help her hide in the tall grass, around trees, and in valleys.

- Frieda can use "Minor Illusion" at will and so will try to trip up the party. DC 12. One minute duration.

- Frieda can also try to charm 2 people per cast. The people will try to stop the party.

**urban chase**

Even roll means nothing happens.

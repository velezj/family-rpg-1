# Summary

[Owlex](../characters/owlex.md), [Gustavo](../characters/gustavo.md), and [Mary](../characters/mary-tanner.md) head over to the village of [Cairston](../places/cairston.md) for a routine cleaning of the sewer system. Originally asking the [Adventurers Guild](../places/adventurers-guild.md), the three-member party sent ten days ago has yet to return. With the [Adventurers Guild](../places/adventurers-guild.md) unable to accept new quests because of lack of manpower, the villagers come to the [Other Guild](../places/other-guild.md) with the request. [Garth](../characters/garth-ven.md) convinces [Mary](../characters/mary-tanner.md) to get out and about (she has been depressed and wallowing around the guild) and tells her to bring along the two new members as good training and experience.

# Narrative Details

During a mid-morning training session with [Mary](../characters/mary-tanner.md), a young man cautiously enters the guild. "Hello? ... Sirs?"  He looks around and hears the sound coming from the training yard. Slowly, he leans out and sees the training. [Garth](../characters/garth-ven.md) quickly notices him.

"Yes? Can I help you?"

The young man takes of his hat, holding it in front of his chest with both hands. "I was told that I could find the [Other Guild](../places/other-guild.md) here...?"

"Yes, and? ..."

"Oh ... excuse me. My name is Ivan Hellman. I came from [Cairston](../places/cairston.md) ... Well ... I was sent from [Cairston](../places/cairston.md) with a request for the [Adventurers Guild](../places/adventurers-guild.md). But when I got there, the guild was closed. I didn't know what to do, so I stood around in front of the closed door .... a kind mam told me that the guild was closed but said there was another guild ... the [Other Guild](../places/other-guild.md) ... that may be able to help me. He pointed me here ...." He looks around at the people training and then back to [Garth](../characters/garth-ven.md).

[Garth](../characters/garth-ven.md) turns towards [Gustavo](../characters/gustavo.md), "Keep practicing what we just talked about. Try to stabilize and strengthen your focus during the second half of the incantation..." He then walks up the Ivan. "Let's hear what you've got lad"

Ivan takes a breath then starts talking. "Fall is coming soon and so we've been harvesting like crazy. Wheat's not growing too well this year ... it's the weather from  the mountains wiping too much ash and sulfur to us ..."

[Garth](../characters/garth-ven.md) stops Ivan from straying from the request.

"Right, sorry .... We found a dead giant rat near the fields. And we all know that were there's one there's many. We need someone to go into the sewers and clean up any vermin before winter sets in and they nest for a season." He stops and looks over at [Mary](../characters/mary-tanner.md) as he hears a particularly loud yell followed by a wide slash from the warrior.

"Seems straightforward enough. Vermin cleanup quest in [Cairston](../places/cairston.md). Anything else you can tell us?"

"Well ... you see ... it's the second time we've made this request. Two weeks ago three adventurers came from the [Adventurers Guild](../places/adventurers-guild.md) to clean up. But we haven't heard from them or the guild ... so we thought we'd ask for more help.... and ... you know ....." and he looks over at the four people in the training yard "... if three adventurers couldn't handle it .... maybe we need more? ... six maybe?"

[Garth](../characters/garth-ven.md) grunts, "[Mary](../characters/mary-tanner.md) come here, we've got work to do!" [Mary](../characters/mary-tanner.md) joins [Garth](../characters/garth-ven.md), looking Ivan over. "They've got a vermin problem over in [Cairston](../places/cairston.md). Seems like they've already found one dead rat ..." As he says the words vermin and [Cairston](../places/cairston.md) she make a small scowl. "... And we've got three missing adventurers from the guild .... probably rookies starting out on their first mission" At that, [Mary](../characters/mary-tanner.md) straightens. Her scowl is replaced with a serious look.

"Got it, [Cairston](../places/cairston.md)" She starts heading into the building but is stopped by [Garth's](../characters/garth-ven.md) quick interjection.

"Take them with you!", and he points to [Owlex](../characters/owlex.md) and [Gustavo](../characters/gustavo.md). As [Mary](../characters/mary-tanner.md) turns with a questioning expression, [Garth](../characters/garth-ven.md) continues, "Its good experience for them. Plus you can always give them real-world examples of the types of jobs adventurers usually do". He grins and turns to look at the two new members. "Nothing like cleaning a sewer to give you a realistic perspective on life.

And so the members of the [Other Guild](../places/other-guild.md) head out on their first request: sewer cleaning.

## On the way to Cairston

[Mary](../characters/mary-tanner.md): "I bet you had irrigation pipes down in Jackson. Did you have a full sewer treatment setup? Not many small villages have a full sewer system, but [Cairston](../places/cairston.md) has a central sewage treatment plant underground that feeds to a nearby lake. You see, there was going to be a lot of chemical processing in [Cairston](../places/cairston.md) and the waste and runoff would kill the nearby forest and creatures without a solid sewer and the magic to have a treatment plant. It's a sight to behold, the first time you see a full sewer plant. Unlike the ones back home, you can actually walk standing up in the tunnels of the main plant. They've even built sidewalks to allow the water mages to check and maintain the plant... unfortunately it's too energy consuming to use magic to make the place smell reasonable, so you'd better be prepared for the stink. When we get the [Cairston](../places/cairston.md) we'll ask them to deliver a few kilograms of Trona crystals to the entrance so at least we can get the stink off our clothes when we're finished." (Trona can be ground into powder that is a mix containing sodium bicarbonate -- baking soda -- and so if you immerse your clothes into powdered trona overnight the smell will be a lot better).

If asked why there *was* going to be processing, will reply: "The wizard never showed up. So now it's just another village in the forest with a few families working the land and gathering what they need."

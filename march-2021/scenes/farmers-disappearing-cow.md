# Narration

As you are traveling along the road the forest slowly gives way to grasslands with gentle hills. You feel the sunlight brighten your mood as the sounds of a peaceful meadow surrounds you; you welcome the animals sounds as you continue on. An hour into the grasslands you see in the distance a another traveler on a cart getting closer. It looks like the cart is full of hay and the horse pulling the cart is clearly a draft horse with broad and sturdy chest muscles to pull till and heavy loads. As they get closer, the person pulls up their hat then stop their cart on the side of the road, seeming to want to let you pass. However, their hands start waving to you. "Hey there!" You're now close enough that you see a middle-aged farmer calling you over to his cart. "You look like you can take care of yourself. I'm a wondering if you could help us farmers out?..." 

Mary: "What is it? Are you having some trouble with bandits or monsters"

Farmer: "My name's Roy. And this here is my farm land where I raise some of the best cows you've ever tasted. Much better than that old Muller's herd I can tell you that much! .... anyhows ... We've been having some problems with missing cows. At fist I just though some wolf's gotten into the pen or they just went exploring and missing. But it's been happening for 2 weeks now, and even Muller's cows have gone missing. And yesterday, we found just the leg of one of my own cows in the middle of the field. Nothing else, just a leg that seems to have been torn right off. We're farmers, not some kind of military fighting force. So I saw you heading our way and though maybe you could help. Now we aren't rich folks around these parts, but you can keep whatever you find and we'll butcher up some meat for you. We can also pay you 3 GP for the work. I know it ain't much, but a cow's full of meat will sell pretty well in a town ... plus these here are good cows with nice meat. Might be able to sell them directly to a noble, if you was to find one who'd be all the way out here, heh. Anyhow we'd be in your debt."

The farmer will escort you to the site of where the leg was found. You can detect a faint, shallow track on the ground, almost like 5 foot wide and shallow impression was pressed on the ground in a somewhat curving line. You begin to follow the trail. Eventually you see a half-melted carcass of a cow, it's head and front legs completely missing. However, the trail ends before you reach the carcass. Looking around, you feel a slight vibration. The ground underneath you burst as you see two long, stiff, brown antennae feel around you follow by gigantic jaw leaking some type of liquid that sputters and smokes as it hits the ground. Roll Initiative.

**after defeating**

With a final shudder the monstrosity seems to cave in on itself and lays still. Mary walks forward and checks to make sure it is dead. "It's dead. Finally" She pulls out a small hand-axe from her back and starts cutting and prying open the carapace. "Owlex, Gustavo. Help me get these plates off. They'll sell for quite a bit in town..." Working together, the three of you speedily butcher the corpse, resulting in a neat stack of scales and plates from the monster. You load them onto the cart. Mary starts walking, circling around the area looking for something in the ground. "Ah ha!" She plunges her swords down into the earth, making a hole appear where she's standing. After the dust settle you barely see the top of her head as she calls you over . "Found its tunnel!" As you draw near, Mary takes out a torch and lights it. You see a roughly 5 foot tunnel in the earth, slowly moving deeper into the soil running along two directions from where Mary broken through from the surface. "These guys are ambush predators. They burrow underground, sensing for life above, then suddenly rear up and grab their prey. They're very territorial and live alone. No-one knows how they reproduce, but everyone agrees that they grab their prey and pull them into the earth, dragging them into a den of sorts before consuming them in piece. The one we beat was a pretty big one, probably been alive for quite some time. This area's full of people coming and going: farmers, workers, adventurers, soldiers, merchants. You name it they've some close to here either going further to the frontier or going back to northern kryta. I'm sure that guy has pulled in quite a number of things. Adventurers know to search until the den is found and collect any keepsakes for the families of the lost. An of course to gather any shiny things that look interesting for their trouble. Let's go this way."

You start walking down the tunnel. Mary barely fits into the space, and she has to duck her head in parts because of the low ceiling. "Keep on hte lookout for any large rocks strewn about. That's where the remains would be." An hour passes as you walk within the cross-crossing tunnels all over the meadow. However, you can tell you're going the right way because the drag marks and spilled refuse pointing towards the direction the creature took it's prey. You find several rock-like balls. Mary cracks them open revealing any items inside of them. These are the Ankheg's droppings. Another hour passes and the tunnels get a little harder to explore because thick roots now block some of the space, making you step around and over them to continue. Finally, you get to an open chamber. It is full of bones, litter, scraps of metal and wood, rotting canvas, and all matter of melted organic materials. Roll Investigation to see what you find.

Near the edge of the tunnels carved by the Arkheg, you notice a small opening to what appears to be a separate series of underground caverns and passageways. However, the sides of the passage and the roughness of the space are clearly different from those you have been traveling down, and you can feel a deep gloom permeating the air, as if resisting anything to do with the light of the sun. "Now this is interesting .... but I think for another time ... let us head back and finish our journey before we delve too deeply into the underground". With that, Mary turns around and starts heading back the way you came.

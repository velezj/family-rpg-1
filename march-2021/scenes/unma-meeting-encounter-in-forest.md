# Narrative

**Batle**

Traveling through the forest along the path to [Juneston](../places/juneston.md), a sole bird call reminds you of the unnatural quiet you have been walking through. Much like the area around [Fir](../places/fir.md), you see no animals or sings of life within the trees. The nice weather, the silence, and the monotonous clopping of the cart lull your minds. You jerk back to being fully aware as a sudden, loud, gravely sound comes from in front. The sound seems to be a sort of growl, unclear whether it's being used a warning or taunt. You also start hearing the sounds of branches cracking and breaking, leaves and dirt crumpling under stress and the flight of the lone bird scared away from whatever lies ahead. Along with the trampling and growling, you hear several heavy thuds and the sound of wood and stone tearing and ripping. 

The sounds come closer. You see a humanoid figure burst onto the path several feet in front of you, running out of the brush. You feel their eyes meet your as they continue to run for several feet, now along the path, then stop and turn towards the opening in the brush they just crashed through. They are wearing a black long coat with silver-white inlays around the edges. Dark attire and straight black hair make the silvery glow of their eye ever more intense. The humanoid slowly pull out two swords and wordlessly focuses on the brush. Without blinking, they surge forward in a dead run then jump high, both sword pointing slight downwards. Just as they crest their jump a muscled tentacle slams into the side of the humanoid, sending them flying to the side. You hear a loud bang as their back hits the nearest tree then a slow creak as the tree uproots itself from the force of the impact, landing directly onto the path. As the sound of the tree-fall dims, a dark shadow moves out of the brush, materializing into a monstrous beast. Its head is like that of a panther, smooth silky fur surrounding a definitively feline face, with large protruding fangs. Dark yellow eyes shining with fury and malevolence take in the scene, from the fallen tree to your wagon and group, to the humanoid rolling themselves off the log and soundlessly readying themselves for battle. With a mighty roar the beast readies itself. Two long and thick tentacles grow from the shoulder blades of the beast, each ending in pads with vicious looking hooks and suckers on them. Six clawed legs tense in anticipation, corded muscle underneath the black skin bulging as the forest floor crumbles under the force of the beast's fury.

**Corpse Burning Immediately After Battle**

Unma will keep their swords out and look at the party, assessing whether friend or foe. If no moves are made for about 1 minute, they will slowly put away their swords, bow/nod their head at the party, then start to build a fire, thinking to burn the corpse of the beast and it's tainted flesh. As they start the fire, they will walk towards the party. "Back". They will slowly point their hands behind you. If the party does not move back, they will once again say "Back" and will take one of their swords, walking forward and beyond the party, stopping a few feet behind them and drawing a line in the sand with the sword before sheathing it. There they will sit on the ground, feet tucked under their feet, staring at the corpse slowly starting to burn. As they see the first hints of smoke from the corpse, they will take out their sword and place it horizontally on the ground before them. "Poison Smoke".

**Asked about Themselves**

When asked about themselves, the humanoid figure will tilt their head sideways, as if thinking or remembering some distant memory. "Unma" they say suddenly. You believe that to be their name. "Hunt. Kill. Destroy Corruption. Find a Pack." Their voice gets a little raspy by the end, as if they have not spoken this many words next to each other in a long time. They sniff the air once and walk towards [Owlex](../characters/owlex.md), coming very close and sniffing a few times, then they will head back to the spot with their sword. They will stay silent then, monitoring the burning of the corpse, not making any moves -- except for tending to their wounds -- nor sounds unless actively questioned. They will answer question in as few words, and as few syllables, as possible. 

As the final chunks of the beast turn ht ash, they will stand and stretch. They begin to run with a powerful, steady gait deeper into the forest. You quickly lose sight of them as they disappear into the woods, and only now realize you never even heard a sound as they got farther away from the party.

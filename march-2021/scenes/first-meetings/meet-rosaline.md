# At rosaline's store/house

Garth: "Hey Rosaline. You Around?"

You hear some quick footsteps from the back of the store and see a red-headed girl dash over to Garth and hugs him, almost knocking him over. "Uncle Garth!" With a pained grunt Garth hugs her back. As they part Rosaline's eyes narrow into a scary expression. Suddenly you see Garth doubled over as she punches him right in the gut. "Do you have ANY idea how long it has been since you said: I'll be right back with it!?" .... "Two months. Three days. And Eleven hours!" ... I thought you were dead uncle."

Garth doesn't quite make eye contact with the furious Rosaline. "Yes well ... the lord who had it sold it to a traveling merchant..." He stopped in the middle of his sentence. You could actually feel the air around Rosaline start to get cold and a small pocket of dim lighting surrounded her, slowly getting bigger.

What you first thought was the researcher and store owner has silently floated behind Rosaline and seems to be pantomiming her feelings as small sparks and teeth appear around it.

"You. Said. It. Was. Yours!!!" The last word was basically snarled by Rosaline as she got closer to Garth and looked him in the eyes. She quickly took out a hand-full of power from a pouch near her waist and threw it over Garth. There was a bright, blinding light after which you see Garth sitting on a chair. There seems to be a large chalkboard floating in front of him and his right hand is holding a piece of chalk up to the board. A dim glow encompasses the scene. Above the chalk board you see a large glittering zero. Rosaline crosses her arms and glares at Garth. He looks like he is speaking but you can't hear anything. With a grimace you see Garth wave his left hand in a complicated pattern then frown. "I adjusted it after our last visit. Your little tricks wont get you out of it this time." Rosaline's smile was very, very scary. After a bit of moving and shifting, you see Garth slump his shoulders and start to write on the bard with a piece of chalk: "I will not steal." After every sentence the glowing counter on top of the chalkboard increased by one. With a click of her tongue Rosaline seems to relax a little bit and finally notices you. The air warms up and brightens around her as a more happy smile appears on her face.

"Ah, welcome to my store. My name is Rosaline Cotswald. How can I help you today?" The girl behind her goes back to the middle of the room and now smiles at you with a serene smile.

While in the [Other Guild](../../places/other-guild.md), [Val](../../characters/val.md) will walk boldly inside and ask to help.

"Hello Fellow Adventurers! I am looking for a group. The Adventurers Guild is closed, but I heard that this ... group ... has been taking requests and helping the people of this fair community." He unhooks his hammer off his back, placing it down on the floor with a heavy thud and a creaking of the floorboards. He'll look down and say, quieter at what is a *normal* speaking voice. "I''m sorry for your floor. I'll help fix it up." You notice that there are fine cracks slowly growing underneath his hammer. At around this point Garth walks in from the back and sees Val taking out several bundles from his bag and is not sitting on the floor. "Ah ... a person! ... I bring offerings of food and sweets ... " He unwraps a large wheel of cheese and several loaves of bread. Standing up, he walks towards Garth and give him a strong slap on the shoulder "Well met! My name is Val and I am looking to help this community. Is this perchance the Other Guild spoken about in the town?"

"Yes. I'm Garth Ven, guildmaster of The Other Guild."

"By Dia I have found you!" Val smack his hand onto the counter to punctuate his excited yell. "I'm ready to help. Ready to put my body to the test and save the wounded, slay the monsters. Bring the light and energy of Dia into this edge of civilization" As he talks he walks over to the entrance and takes out a small hammer and a gadget of some sort. With a quick, shape hit that makes the door frame shake, there is not a symbol nailed to the side of the door.

"Now there, what do you think you're doing!?" Garth walks over behind Val.

"Good, good. I can feel Dia's peace in this place. It is a good place, and stalwart. With this Dia's blessing will be known by all"

Seeing that the symbol next to the door is, in fact, a silver sign of Dia along with a crest of the Peace Domain, Garth wipes his face with his hands before giving a deep sight. "So, you're here to help are you?"

Now back to sitting on the floor, Val deftly cuts a wedge of cheese and hands it to Garth, then throws him a full loaf. "Yes. I carry the words and energy of Dia to this side of kryta. It has been far to quiet of late, and I found the frontier a temptation I could not ignore. We must never stand still. We must journey forth and root out the evil and bring peace. Joyful, energetic, passionate peace to those who would reject monsters and their ilk."

Garth slowly stare at the symbol, then at the cracks on the floor, than back to Val, before slowly heading towards the counter and placing down this food. He takes a byte of the cheese. "This is quiet good, did you get it around here?"

"Ah yes, from a farm near the coast that breed their own type of sheep. It is very pleasant even though the sheep themselves stank worse that a goblin's socks"

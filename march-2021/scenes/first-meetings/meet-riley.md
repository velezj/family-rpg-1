# Narrative

As you head out of [Beggarsbottom](../../places/beggarsbottom/story.md), a donkey and cart pulls in front of you. Riding on top is a tall and broad half-orc, and you realize that the donkey is, in fact, a horse and was simply dwarfed by the massive frame. The half-orc leisurely steps off the cart and gives a small bow, palms together in front. They are dressed in a simple and colorful shirt and long skirt, both looking worn in and comfortable. Their left leg shows scaring from the knew down to the top of the well-made boot and they lean slightly to the right as they stand in front of you using a staff for support.

"My friends, I heard that you are traveling to [Cairston](../../places/cairston.md). I am in need of materials from the forest, including lumber and some herbs. It seems the forest has gotten dangerous of late. Even as I traveled here I sensed a quiet stillness in the forest, as if beast and plant were waiting in anticipation and fear. I would rather step back into that space with more at my side. Of course, I'm not asking to just simply ride on your wake. I would like to pay you to be my guards until we reach [Cairston](../../places/cairston.md). It is already on your way, I believe. And there is safety in numbers. As you can see I have my own cart to gather my materials, and I have tools and plenty of experience to gather them quickly. I doubt I would delay your arrival by more than a few hours."


if asked what they do:
"I am a crafter of both fine and practical ship, boats, and any other sea-worthy vessel you can name. But around here I am also quite a carver and an adequate carpenter. But the material for today are to fix up an old farmhouse near here. The owner's daughter just wed and the new couple needs a proper home of their own. Given that it's his only daughter, the owner hired me to build his daughter a lovely cottage that is both sturdy and elegant. That is why am I looking for materials from around the area. I find it best to work with the local resources, as they are already in harmony in nature, so they are in harmony together in craft."


if asked how they knew the party was headed to [Cairston](../../places/cairston.md):
"I must admit we have met before, in front of the closed [Adventurers Guild](../../places/adventurers-guild.md). I can tell you are a party that handles itself well. So I asked around, and perhaps I also may have followed you around town. I overheard your conversation with the [Cairston lad](../../scenes/sewers-1.md) and I thought: what a great opportunity to travel safely and keep an eye on you at the same time."



if asked why they want to keep an eye out:
"Well." He gives a small bow at [Mary](../../characters/mary-tanner.md) in particular. "You are of some interest to me." They use their staff to draw lines on the earth. When they are done, you see the unmistakable, and uncanny, image of [Mary's scar](../../setting-world/marys-scar.md) on the ground. During the time they were drawing, their eyes never flickered away from Mary's; a feat of a master artist for sure. "Perhaps, as we travel, I can entertain you with a tale you may be interested in hearing"

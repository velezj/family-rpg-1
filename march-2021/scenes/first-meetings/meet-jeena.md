As the party is walking around [Beggarsbottom](../../places/beggarsbottom/story.md), [Gustavo's](../../characters/gustavo.md) sight suddenly goes black and he falls to the ground as a weight hits his back, settling onto his shoulders. You can feel two hands covering your eyes and hear a voice behind you, "Found you!" Then you feel little puffs of air around you neck and shoulders. "Ahh, what a nice smell .... *giggle*" You hear a slight purring as the sniffing continues around you body until it finally stops next to the book. With one last, deep, whiff, the weight lifts off your shoulders and the hands let go, no longer covering your eyes. You turn to find a small tiefling with their hands behind their back smiling at you with a gleaming, full, smile.

She's wearing a long, flowing blue dress. Plain and simple but it hangs on her well. Her horns have twin tassels of some form of shiny green lace. You can see a few sparkling motes float down from the tassels and swirl around her. Behind her you see two folded black wings, a rare trait of some tieflings whose demon blood is particularly strong. Around her neck a small chain holds a silver symbol that seems familiar to you. {On a DC 10 will remember it is the symbol on the book}

"I've been looking for you for sooooooo long .... it was so boring *pout* ...." She claps her hands "But now I found you, yay!" "Give your big sister a hug..." She spreads her hands wide and waits for a bit, then turns her head sideways. "ahhh, " holding a finger to her lips, "You must be entering the rebellious phase ... your so adorable I could just hug you and snuggle you ...." she starts to mumble and her eyes glass over as she is lost in thought. Shaking her head as if to shake her thoughts back in track, she finally seems to notice the rest of the party.

"Oh, sorry ... you probably want to know my name. I'm [Jeena](../../characters/jeena.md), and this is [Erutrea's](../../setting-world/erutrea.md) Chosen" She points to [Gustavo](../../characters/gustavo.md), "And you are?" "Oh, I known. Are these your friends. Wow, one of them looks really strong, and the other one looks pretty responsible" She bows her head and turns serious. "Thank you for taking care of my brother."

title: Invite to Sleep at Mary's
---

Once the party gets to [Beggarsbottom](../places/beggarsbottom/story.md), [Mary](../characters/mary-tanner.md) will ask what their plans are for lodging. Seeing how the kids are poor, Mary will tell them that she has a place to stay she can share with them. She will also be willing to guide them around [Beggarsbottom](../places/beggarsbottom/story.md) to places they want to see. She will push becoming adventurers since it lets them explore (for [Gustavo](../characters/gustavo.md) ) and raises money (for [Owlex](../characters/owlex.md)).

If asked, [Mary](../characters/mary-tanner.md) will say she knows someone that might be able to teach [Gustavo](../characters/gustavo.md) or at least know someone who can.

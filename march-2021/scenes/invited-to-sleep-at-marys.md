Once the party gets to Beggarsbottom, Mary will ask what their plans are for lodging. Seeing how the kids are poor, Mary will tell them that she has a place to stay she can share with them. She will also be willing to guide them around Beggarsbottom to places they want to see. She will push becoming adventurers since it lets them explore (Gustavo) and raises money (Owlex).

If asked, Mary will say she knows someone that might be able to teach Gustavo or at least know someone who can.

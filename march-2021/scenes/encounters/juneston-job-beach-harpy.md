# Details

You have taken the job to collect 30 fresh Maxima clams. None of you are particularly knowledgeable about Maxima clams in specific, so it may take a while to find them.

| Investigation Roll       | Time to Find Spot |
|--------------------------|-------------------|
| < 5                      | 6 hours           |
| 5 - 10                   | 4 hours           |
| 11 - 15                  | 3 hours           |
| >= 16                    | 2 hours           |
| If asked villagers where | half time         |

You arrive at a spot that you are sure has clams. As you look over the water you notice a spot that seems different, darker even.

| 15 - 17     | you know that colder water usually looks darker and you believe this is some type of whirlpool or current |
| > 18        | You know this is a rip-tide that is deadly if caught in but it is safe 15 ft or more from edge            |
|             |                                                                                                           |


Once you locate where the clams are, you start picking up the clams. You are looking for fresh Maxima clams that are still alive. How many do you pick?

| Nature Roll | Fraction Fresh and Alive |
|-------------|--------------------------|
| < 5         | 0.1                      |
| 5-10        | 0.5                      |
| 11-14       | 0.8                      |
| > 14        | 1.0                      |

As you pick up the clams you hear a rustling above you and see a group of Harpy. Looks like the sight of fresh clams, and fresh blood, have gotten their attention.

The Harpys will try to lure you with their song into the rip-tide.

| Distance to Center of Current | Athletics Check | result                       |

| >  15 from edge               | < 10            | pulled 10 to middle          |
|                               | >= 10           | ok                           |
| 15 - 0 from edge              | < 13            | pulled 10 to middle          |
|                               | >= 13           | ok                           |
| inside outer circle           | < 15            | pulled 10 to middle          |
|                               | >= 15           | can move 10 from center      |
| inside inner circle           | < 18            | pulled to middle             |
|                               | >= 18           | can move 10 away from middle |


For every turn a create starts inside the rip-tide they take 1d6 force damage and are move 5 ft. to the right.

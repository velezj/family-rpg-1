title: Harpy over Hills (Juneston Jobs)

# Details

While on any of the jobs from [Juneston](../../places/juneston.md) that have to go over the hills (not the forest), there is a chance that the party will encounter some harpys.

Harpy do *not* usually attack over open lands and prefer cliffs and territory with many environmental hazards. They encounter a group because the lack of adventurers have left the Harpy population to "overpopulate" and hence the weaker creatures are being pushed out of their normal hunting zones and nest zones. These weaker harpy are starving and desperate hence they will attack over the hill and grasslands.

# Encounter

- The harpy will try to grab a character and fly up to drop them down to injure them rather than try to attack them directly.

- The harpy will be desperate and will not flee

- The harpy may be in a weakened state (disadvantage) depending on the encounter roll and level of PC

# Story Elements

The Harpy will be spotted from far off in a clear day. Weather may obscure the harpy until it is quite close. The Stirge are harder to see since some might be stuck to the Harpy. As the party gets within range, the Harpy will actually fall to the ground with the Stirge swarm either leaving (level 1) or seeing the party as easier food that cannot fly.

If [Juneston](../../places/juneston.md) mayor or any town local is informed of the dead harpy and the Stirge, party will get a reward for killing it and the village will send a full request for Harpy extermination to the [Adventurers Guild](../../places/adventurers-guild.md). If the Harpy is brought to the village Evan will take it off your hands saying that the talons and feather are useful in designs. 

If the harpy is brought to a farm, or a farm told about it rather than the mayor, the farmer will thank you and will treat you to provisions and a few coins for the effort.

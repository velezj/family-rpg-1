# Narrative Details

The party heads out from Juneston to the west where the forest edge is. They will be looking for at least 5 boar carcasses in order toe make enough lye.

Mary: "Have you ever fought wild boar before?" (no) "They're tough. Sometimes you think that their down but then they get back up again and keep charging at you. Usually the male boars will search for food and keep their territory alone. The female boars will group together in shallow dens. I've seen them in groups of 20 or even 30 female boar all bundled together. Boars hunt in the night, so during the daytime is the best way to sneak up on them while they are resting and take them out. Keep the boars close o you. If they can get a running start, their charges can knock you down and then you are easier to trample with their sharp tusks. According to the job, we're looking for at least 5 Wild Boar. These aren't just normal boar that live off the land, these are monsters that mutated from normal boar. They will attack and eat anything they can. They are extremely aggressive and are a danger to everything living around the forest. They will even target themselves for sport, the winner eating the loser."

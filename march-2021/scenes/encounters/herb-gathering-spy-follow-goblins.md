# Story Elements

- the goblin party is a resources gathering unit for [Molvat's](../../characters/molvat.md) group.

- The cave is the farthest into the villages [Molvat](../../characters/molvat.md) has gotten. It is planned to be a new base of operations for further incursions. 

- The imp was "leased" to [Molvat](../../characters/molvat.md) from the [Demon Lord](../../setting-world/demon-lord.md) to watch the operation. There are more watchers too. [Molvat](../../characters/molvat.md) sent imp to create this forward strategic position.

- The goblins have been over-hunting the forest hence the wolves were starving (if encountered)

The party finds the goblin cave nearest [Fir](../../places/fir.md)

# Narrative

You stumble upon a cave entrance. The tracks of many creates are scattered around the entrance heading in and out every direction. You see a group of guards around the cave: 2 goblins (with bows and scimitars), 2 hobgoblins. On a perception check DC 17 you also see a bugbear hiding. On a perception check DC 19 you see and imp sitting near the top of the entrance, looking around. The goblins looked bored, but the two hobgoblins are alert, scanning the areas in front and around the cave entrance. 

If the party stays watching/waiting for more that 10 minutes:
- You see a goblin walking into view on top of the cave entrance. It looks like it is on patrol around the top and back side of the cave. Along with the goblin you spot a large spider. There will be a total of 4 patrol groups, each having a giant spider and a single goblin. They make a round every 10 minutes.

If the party stays watching/waits for more than 30 minutes
- You see a group of 6 goblins and a bugbear hauling two carts full of resources come into the clearing and go into the cave. You notice that the new  bugbear seems to signal to the hobgoblin guards flanking the cave entrance before entering the cave. On a perception DC 15 you can tell that the bugbear gave a password and can remember what it is.

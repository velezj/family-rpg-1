# Details

While acting as guards to the herbalist from [Fir](../../places/fir.md) you get to the place where the herbs are. However, you see that both locations are guarded by monsters. The herbalist will conceded that because the party was with them the herbs being gathered are the more dangerous type in the more dangerous locations. 

Herb Whitecap is being guarded by a Giant wasps and their minions because of it's sweet nectar.

Herb Bloomswell is being guarded by a Quickling.

## Bloomswell

As the party moves closer to the Star Twinkle tree, they will hear a voice.
"Go away! Go, Go, Go Away" The voice seems to echo around the party in a high pitch. 

The party rolls a perception roll to see what they notice:
| roll    | effect                                                                                 |
|---------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| < 10    | Party does not see or notice anything around them                                      |
| 10 - 17 | The party realizes that the voice seems to be a single voice moving around them        |
| 18 - 20 | The party notices a slight blur and shimmer moving on the ground quickly on the ground |
| >= 21   | The party notices a Quickling running around the party                                 |
|         |                                                                                        |

The Quickling is not hostile but is not a friend either. It is guarding the Star Twinkle tree.
The quickling is guarding the tree from the goblins and monsters that have recently moved into the forest. Being Fey, Quicklings have some trouble differentiating monsters and races of the dawn, so they will assume the party is also made of monsters. This tree is important to the family of this Quickling, it is in fact the mortal grave of their ancestral matriarch.

"You cannot take this tree. Go, go away!"

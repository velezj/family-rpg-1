Two goblins and a giant wolf spider are making the rounds outside of the goblin cave nearest to Fir.

# Narrative

As you are traveling through the forest, still a bit lost, you faintly hear what sounds like an argument. As you stop and pay attention, you can hear sounds of talking.

| Perception Roll | result                                                                     |
|-----------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| < 12            | can't make out what is being said                                          |
| 12 - 17         | can tell the language is goblin or a close relative                        |
| >= 18           | can tell it *is* goblin and it sounds like an argument between 2 creatures |
|                 |                                                                            |

If you get closer you make out 2 goblins. With a Perception DC of 18 you also see a giant wolf spider along with the two goblins. The party needs to beat a stealth check DC 14 or be heard/seen by the spider (who will discretely signal the goblins).

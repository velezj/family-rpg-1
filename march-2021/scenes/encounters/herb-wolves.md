# Details

While acting as guards for herb gathering near [Fir](../../places/fir.md), a small half-starved pack of wolves will sense their presence and try to attack (in desperation).

Checks:

- Make a perception check, DC 10, to hear the wolf calls getting closer as the wolves realize the party is nearby.

- Make a perception check, DC 16, to hear the wolves stalking the party.

- Make a perception check, DC 18, to see the wolves getting near.


# Encounter

- If both hearing and seeing perception checks fail, the wolves will surprise the party and will have one round.

- The villager will have a satchel of herbs that if lit will *usually* deter wolves. At the current concentration, the wolves are desperate enough that they will keep trying for the party until the herbs have burned for a minute (10 rounds). Every round afterwards the wolves have to make a will check, DC 12, to flee from the smell.

- wolves are pack hunters and will try to separate the weakest of the group (NPC) and attack them.

- The wolves will stop attacking the party if food is offered (meat, reasonably freshly killed)

# Story Elements

- The party will notice the wolves are malnourished and starving

- On a perception check, DC 15, the party will notice that the lead wolf has a slashing wound not made by any animal you know.

- On a nature DC 15 or investigation DC 15 the party notices the wound was caused by a sword or other sharp tool.

# Details

While traveling from [Juneston](../../places/juneston.md) to [Beggarsbottom](../../places/beggarsbottom/story.md) the party will go through the territory of the Harpys. Because of the closing of the [Adventurers Guild](../../places/adventurers-guild.md) the Harpys have grown bolder and have overpopulated. The weak one are therefore pushed out of their normal homes (near cliffs and forests) and into the open grasslands and hills around [Juneston](../../places/juneston.md) and [Marksfield](../../places/marksfield/story.md).

# Narrative

On the way to Beggardsbottom, the party encounters a lone, weakened harpy being fed upon by a group of Stirge. The Stirge smell new blood and start going for the party. The harpy flies low and falls on the group, but only briefly, before a primal hunger seeps out of it's eyes as it sees dinner in front of it.

# Reward

If [Juneston](../../places/juneston.md) mayor or any town local is informed of the dead harpy and the Stirge, party will get a reward for killing it and the village will send a full request for Harpy extermination to the [Adventurers Guild](../../places/adventurers-guild.md). If the Harpy is brought to the village Evan will take it off your hands saying that the talons and feather are useful in designs. 

If the harpy is brought to a farm, or a farm told about it rather than the mayor, the farmer will thank you and will treat you to provisions and a few coins for the effort.

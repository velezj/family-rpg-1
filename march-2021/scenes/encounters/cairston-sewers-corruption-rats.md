# Details

The party enters the sewer system, which is a bit away from the main village center, from above ground into the underground. There the party meets with giant rats (expected) and grubs (expected) but also the "awakened grubs" which are new. If they decide to go further, they will meet up with [Kosuto](../../characters/kusoto-mari.md) and [Mika](../../characters/mika-strawfur.md).

Further in, they will encounter a advanced training group for [Molvat](../../characters/molvat.md)

# Encounter

Split into a series of 3 encounters:

1. Rats and Grubs (awakened) as introduction fight.

1. More awakened grubs as they go deeper

1. Goblin training group (main "boss")


# Story Elements

- Awakened grubs are new. Will need to be taken to [Beggarsbottom](../../places/beggarsbottom/story.md) to have it investigated

- If partying with rat-folk, we learn of the village (hidden) and that the awakened grubs have been a problem there.

- Finding the training group this close to [Cairston](../../places/cairston.md) is alarming! Why are there goblins in the sewers? They seemed more organized than most tribes. Also using hyenas.

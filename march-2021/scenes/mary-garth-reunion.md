title: Mary and [Garth](../characters/garth-ven.md) Reunion
---

When [Mary](../characters/mary-tanner.md) brings [Gustavo](../characters/gustavo.md) and [Owlex](../characters/owlex.md) to the [Other Guild](../places/other-guild.md), she yells out to see if [Garth](../characters/garth-ven.md) is still alive.

*knock knock* on the door them [Mary](../characters/mary-tanner.md) walks in
"Hey, [Garth](../characters/garth-ven.md) ... you still alive you old husk!"
"... Who's calling me and old husk ..." [Garth](../characters/garth-ven.md) walk in from the upstairs of the guild. 

You see a wrinkled, tanned gnome. His gray hair and bears are mostly trimmed neatly. Even after all the years, he stands tall and steady. You can see toned muscles under his clothing. His hands are calloused and his right fingertips are blackened as if repeatedly smudged with ink over years of use. Around his neck you see a peculiar glass amulet. You think it may be a monocle, but it is strangely decorative and looks far to fragile for everyday use. The gnome steps down the set of stairs and it's only when he stops in front of you that you realize not a single sounds was heard as he quickly stepped down the stair steps.

As [Garth](../characters/garth-ven.md) sees [Mary](../characters/mary-tanner.md) his face open into a broad grin. 

When [Mary](../characters/mary-tanner.md) sees [Garth](../characters/garth-ven.md), she begins to grin, but then her face stiffens and her eyes look down slightly.

"Well look what the cat dragged in today. [Mary](../characters/mary-tanner.md)!" [Garth](../characters/garth-ven.md) moves to hug her.

Her body jerks back. The look in her eyes showing her own surprise as [Garth](../characters/garth-ven.md) stops just before hugging her.

[Garth](../characters/garth-ven.md) takes a more careful and thorough look at [Mary](../characters/mary-tanner.md). "Oh lass ...." He plucks at a piece of her armor near he hips, surprising [Mary](../characters/mary-tanner.md) and everyone else at how fast and nimble the movement was. [Mary](../characters/mary-tanner.md)'s shield and right armor fall away, revealing her new shoulder bandages which are full of dried blood.

At that, [Mary](../characters/mary-tanner.md)'s head falls down and tears start gathering at the corners of her yes.


[Garth](../characters/garth-ven.md) grabs her left hand and says "Welcome back..."

[Mary](../characters/mary-tanner.md) stays silent for a moment, then she falls on her knees and hugs [Garth](../characters/garth-ven.md), "I'm back". 

After a bit, [Mary](../characters/mary-tanner.md) pulls back and wipes her tears. "I brought some kids that need a place to stay, thought I could share my room with them if you're good with that?"

[Garth](../characters/garth-ven.md) finally looks at [Gustavo](../characters/gustavo.md) and [Owlex](../characters/owlex.md), inspecting them up and down. He looks over at [Gustavo](../characters/gustavo.md) and his staff, squints his eyes. "So yer a wizard. eh?" After another look, he stares directly into [Gustavo](../characters/gustavo.md)'s eyes, "Natural talent I see .... wild ... and strong, definitely strong"   Then he looks over at [Owlex](../characters/owlex.md). "And you ... well ... you've got some potential I can see, not sure for what though ...." He blinks a little bit and then rushes up to [Owlex](../characters/owlex.md) and looks her straight in the eyes. " well well .... looks like someone's claimed you already .... yes I see it's mark now ...." Kneeling down so he's level with [Owlex](../characters/owlex.md), "Little lady, you've go some power inside you"

[Garth](../characters/garth-ven.md) gets up and spread his hands out wide. "Welcome to the Other Guild." As he sees [Gustavo](../characters/gustavo.md)'s and [Owlex](../characters/owlex.md)'s lack of recognition, he turns towards [Mary](../characters/mary-tanner.md). "You did tell them anything about us, did you?" 

[Mary](../characters/mary-tanner.md) for the first time flashes a little smile, "I know you love introductions Guild Master"

With a sputter and a cough, [Garth](../characters/garth-ven.md) turns back to [Gustavo](../characters/gustavo.md) and [Owlex](../characters/owlex.md) with his hands help up and wide. "Well then, let me introduce my self. My name of [Garth](../characters/garth-ven.md) Ven and I am the Guild Master here. This is the Other Guild." he turns around taking in the single room the party can see.

[Gustavo](../characters/gustavo.md) and [Owlex](../characters/owlex.md) wait expectantly for [Garth](../characters/garth-ven.md) to continue while [Garth](../characters/garth-ven.md) just keeps his hands up encompassing the room. [Mary](../characters/mary-tanner.md) gives a little head shake and stands back up. "[Garth](../characters/garth-ven.md) here creating this guild as a place for Adventurers to gather and take requests, just like the [Adventurer's Guild](../places/adventurers-guild.md). However, the [Other Guild](../places/other-guild.md) only takes requests to help people in need. All of our requests are vetted by [Garth](../characters/garth-ven.md) or Myself, and we make sure that those who we help were truly in need of help. For one, we do not help commit crimes, or help criminals in committing crimes. We also do not hunt bounties for anything other than monsters, unless the target is truly hurting the client." You can tell that both [Mary](../characters/mary-tanner.md) and [Garth](../characters/garth-ven.md) recalled a bad experience as she says that as both quickly grimace.

"Hehhehheh, That's right," [Garth](../characters/garth-ven.md) starts speaking. "We're a group of Adventurers who were tired of taking quests for one noble or another to fetch a trophy beast or guard their gems as they move from one keep to another." He cracks his knuckles and spit down. "Anyone can post a request to the [Adventurer's Guild](../places/adventurers-guild.md), and any of the supposed comrades in the guild can take the requests. Not here! Here you can only posts requests we think are worthy of adventurers. Requests to help those who need it, not just a job that pays but a calling that helps people. That's who belongs to the [Other Guild](../places/other-guild.md)" He beams a little by the end of the speech and you can tell how proud he is of the [Other Guild](../places/other-guild.md).


"I heard you need a place to sleep? You're welcome here. We've got space since all our members are out fighting the [Demon Lord](../setting-world/demon-lord.md)." [Mary](../characters/mary-tanner.md) winces at this and [Garth](../characters/garth-ven.md) clears his throat as he realized that with [Mary](../characters/mary-tanner.md) back not all the members were out.

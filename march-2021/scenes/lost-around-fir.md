The party encounters a group of goblins being led by a Bugbear. They decide to split up. [Sam](../characters/samantha-teastead.md) heads to [Fir](../places/fir.md) to get backup with a magical paper dog sent by [Gustavo](../characters/gustavo.md) to help track the rest of the party via sense for [Sam](../characters/samantha-teastead.md) to bring help to the right place. The remainder of the party, [Gustavo](../characters/gustavo.md), [Owlex](../characters/owlex.md), and [Mary](../characters/mary-tanner.md), begin to follow the group, keeping tabs on what they are doing and where they are going. 

# The Fleeting Slip

About and hour after the split, the Bugbear hears the sound of [Mary](../characters/mary-tanner.md) and her suit of armor tailing the goblins. The Bugbear fires a precise shot, embedding an arrow into [Owlex's](../characters/owlex.md) shoulder and causing near-death damage to her. The party decides to flee. [Gustavo](../characters/gustavo.md) recalls his paper dong and creates and Elk for him to ride on while [Mary](../characters/mary-tanner.md) chugs a potion and picks up [Owlex](../characters/owlex.md) onto her back. With [Owlex](../characters/owlex.md) guiding [Mary](../characters/mary-tanner.md) and [Gustavo](../characters/gustavo.md) trusting the instincts of the Elk, they manage to flee far enough and fast enough that the goblins no longer seem to be pursuing. During the flight [Owlex](../characters/owlex.md) bandaged up her arm although she is still very hurt. After 20 minutes, the adrenaline flushes out of their system and the party's tunnel vision clears to a dark, unknown, night-time deep forest. It is a moon-less night because of cloud-cover and the single member of the party in the forest is [Owlex](../characters/owlex.md), who is hurt and only has dark vision of 60 ft.

# Goblin Patrol

If the party stays around the forest moving more that 10 hours (not counting sleep/rests), they will run into a goblin patrol. They can try to follow them, hide and flee, or fight them.

# Goblin Cave

If the party stays around the forest moving for more that 15 hours (not counting rest/sleep), they will stumble upon the goblin cave.

# Sam and Fir' Mayor Decision

While the rest of the party follows the goblins (an then flees), [Sam](../characters/samantha-teastead.md) heads back to [Fir](../places/fir.md). She is nimble and she knows these woods so she makes good time, getting to [Fir](../places/fir.md) in 1.5 hours rather than 3 hours like the party would have taken. Halfway there, the magical dog disappears, and [Sam](../characters/samantha-teastead.md) starts running as quick as she possibly can and still be safe in the dark forest: something must have happened to [Gustavo](../characters/gustavo.md) for the dog to poof like that. When she gets to [Fir](../places/fir.md) she immediately wakes up the mayor and explains what they had seen: a goblin party being led by a much larger, and hairy, goblin-like monster. Not only that, but the goblins were carrying carts with building materials and resources, which indicates they have a hideout somewhere in the deep woods because no-one would carry trees from this deep to the edges of the forest. There is a goblin group somewhere near [Fir](../places/fir.md), or at least they were seen 3 hours away, deeper into the forest. She then tells him of the party, and how they were keeping tabs on the goblins while she came here to inform the village and bring help. At this point it is roughly 1 AM. The mayor wipes his face with his hand then looks straight at  [Sam](../characters/samantha-teastead.md). "You re the fastest of us. The quickest and most able runner we have. You have to go to [Beggarsbottom](../places/beggarsbottom/story.md) and tell the [Adventurers Guild](../places/adventurers-guild.md) about the goblins. We need them to send a team to deal with these monsters ... Tell them we can pay 10 GP per goblin, and 50 GP for the leader.' He wipes his sweaty brow as he internally sighs at the amount of money they will need to spend, then looks up at the sky. "It is near morning. The sun will be out soon, and your guards took that job for a reason. They are tough and can handle themselves. When day breaks, we''l round up a group of our men and women and canvas the forest around [Fir](../places/fir.md). Well head to where you saw the goblins and where last you saw your guards to investigate. We need to make sure there are no other goblins nearer to the village, and we need to find your guards and find out what they know, where the goblins went, and how many more there are." [Sam](../characters/samantha-teastead.md) slowly nods, as she realizes she is the fastest and best way to get help, and it is true the rest of the team can take care of itself, as they showed both with the wolves and the insects. She heads of towards [Beggarsbottom](../places/beggarsbottom/story.md) as quickly as she can, taking with her a stash of [Tea of Vitality](../items/tea-of-vitality.md) for the journey. She will travel through the forest rather than the road since she knows the forest around the area and she is adept at forest travel.


| Sam Survival Rolls (x3) | Base time to Beggarsbottom                                               |
|-------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| >= 24                   | 14 + 1 hours normal = 15 hours                                           |
|                         | because of area knowledge and ability, forest is *not* difficult terrain |
|                         | so for Sam:                                                              |
|                         | 7 + 1 hours = 8 hours                                                    |
| < 24                    | add 1d6+1 hours to travel                                                |


[Sam](../characters/samantha-teastead.md) will be tired after a whole day, and now she is running throughout the night, so fatigue is settling in. She does however, drink the [Tea of Vitality](../items/tea-of-vitality.md) every hour, given her a +1 constitution.

| Sam Constitution roll (x3) | Time modifier                         |
|----------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| < 36                       | 25% more time, so 8 * 1.25 = 10 hours |
| >= 36                      | no additional time                    |


	
# The Collapse

An hour after fleeing from the goblins, about 12 midnight, [Mary](../characters/mary-tanner.md) will collapse onto the ground, unable to move. The effects of the [Potion of Cheetah's Folly](../items/potion-of-cheetas-folly.md) she drank are kicking in. She vomits up a dark green liquid and dry heaves as she lays on the ground. 

Mary rolls a wisdom check DC 15 to see if she yells at [Owlex](../characters/owlex.md) before the potion wears off or not. On fail, [Owlex](../characters/owlex.md) will fall from her shoulder. With an acrobatics or athletics check *with disadvantage* save with a DC of 10 she stumbles but lands well. On a fail she takes 1d4 bludgeon damage.

Mary: "I need to sleep, my body isn't going to move anytime soon. And you must also be fatigued." she starts to say something else but then falls deeply asleep. On a perception or medicine check of DC 10 you know she's just sleeping not unconscious.

Given the lack of animals in the forest, nothing will disturb them in their rest. With a survival check DC 15 they will even find a willow tree under which they can camp without been seen and be quite save even inside a normal, animal filled, forest.


# The Fir Canvas

Once the morning comes, the mayor of [Fir](../places/fir.md) will gather a group of 12 mean and women to canvas the nearby forest for any signs of goblins. Their *eventual* goal is to head to where [Sam](../characters/samantha-teastead.md) had seen the goblin group, and hopefully to meetup with the party. However, their *main* concern is whether there are any monsters nearby that could harm the village, and if so to either destroy the monsters or evacuate the people of [Fir](../places/fir.md) to safety. At their current speed, the group will take the given amount of time to get within a radius of [Fir](../places/fir.md):

| hours from Fir radius | Time for Group to Check/Arrive       |
|-----------------------|--------------------------------------|
| 1                     | 3                                    |
| 2                     | 12                                   |
| 3                     | 27                                   |
| 4                     | 48                                   |
| x                     | 3 * x^2 (area of circle from radius) |
|                       |                                      |

This means that they will reach the spot where the goblins where spotted in 27 hours of searching. The group will only search during the daytime, with a separate group of 12 each day, until they get to the spot where the goblins where seen (3 hours from [Fir](../places/fir.md) for a normal person). Getting to the spot will take them 27 hours of searching, which means they will reach it 3 hours into the third day of searching (total of 51 hours passed).

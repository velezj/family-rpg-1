The party encounters a group of goblins being led by a Bugbear. They decide to split up. [Sam](../characters/samantha-teastead.md) heads to [Fir](../places/fir.md) to get backup with a magical paper dog sent by [Gustavo](../characters/gustavo.md) to help track the rest of the party via sense for [Sam](../characters/samantha-teastead.md) to bring help to the right place. The remainder of the party, [Gustavo](../characters/gustavo.md), [Owlex](../characters/owlex.md), and [Mary](../characters/mary-tanner.md), begin to follow the group, keeping tabs on what they are doing and where they are going. 

# The Fleeting Slip

About and hour after the split, the Bugbear hears the sound of [Mary](../characters/mary-tanner.md) and her suit of armor tailing the goblins. The Bugbear fires a precise shot, embedding an arrow into [Owlex's](../characters/owlex.md) shoulder and causing near-death damage to her. The party decides to flee. [Gustavo](../characters/gustavo.md) recalls his paper dong and creates and Elk for him to ride on while [Mary](../characters/mary-tanner.md) chugs a potion and picks up [Owlex](../characters/owlex.md) onto her back. With [Owlex](../characters/owlex.md) guiding [Mary](../characters/mary-tanner.md) and [Gustavo](../characters/gustavo.md) trusting the instincts of the Elk, they manage to flee far enough and fast enough that the goblins no longer seem to be pursuing. During the flight [Owlex](../characters/owlex.md) bandaged up her arm although she is still very hurt. After 20 minutes, the adrenaline flushes out of their system and the party's tunnel vision clears to a dark, unknown, night-time deep forest. It is a moon-less night because of cloud-cover and the single member of the party in the forest is [Owlex](../characters/owlex.md), who is hurt and only has dark vision of 60 ft.

# Goblin Patrol

If the party stays around the forest lost and moving more that 4 hours (not counting sleep/rests), they will run into a goblin patrol. They can try to follow them, hide and flee, or fight them.

# Goblin Cave

If the party stays around the forest moving for more that 12 hours (not counting rest/sleep), they will stumble upon the goblin cave.

# Sam and Fir' Mayor Decision

While the rest of the party follows the goblins (an then flees), [Sam](../characters/samantha-teastead.md) heads back to [Fir](../places/fir.md). She is nimble and she knows these woods so she makes good time, getting to [Fir](../places/fir.md) in 1.5 hours rather than 3 hours like the party would have taken. Halfway there, the magical dog disappears, and [Sam](../characters/samantha-teastead.md) starts running as quick as she possibly can and still be safe in the dark forest: something must have happened to [Gustavo](../characters/gustavo.md) for the dog to poof like that. When she gets to [Fir](../places/fir.md) she immediately wakes up the mayor and explains what they had seen: a goblin party being led by a much larger, and hairy, goblin-like monster. Not only that, but the goblins were carrying carts with building materials and resources, which indicates they have a hideout somewhere in the deep woods because no-one would carry trees from this deep to the edges of the forest. There is a goblin group somewhere near [Fir](../places/fir.md), or at least they were seen 3 hours away, deeper into the forest. She then tells him of the party, and how they were keeping tabs on the goblins while she came here to inform the village and bring help. At this point it is roughly 1 AM. The mayor wipes his face with his hand then looks straight at  [Sam](../characters/samantha-teastead.md). "You re the fastest of us. The quickest and most able runner we have. You have to go to [Beggarsbottom](../places/beggarsbottom/story.md) and tell the [Adventurers Guild](../places/adventurers-guild.md) about the goblins. We need them to send a team to deal with these monsters ... Tell them we can pay 10 GP per goblin, and 50 GP for the leader.' He wipes his sweaty brow as he internally sighs at the amount of money they will need to spend, then looks up at the sky. "It is near morning. The sun will be out soon, and your guards took that job for a reason. They are tough and can handle themselves. When day breaks, we''l round up a group of our men and women and canvas the forest around [Fir](../places/fir.md). Well head to where you saw the goblins and where last you saw your guards to investigate. We need to make sure there are no other goblins nearer to the village, and we need to find your guards and find out what they know, where the goblins went, and how many more there are." [Sam](../characters/samantha-teastead.md) slowly nods, as she realizes she is the fastest and best way to get help, and it is true the rest of the team can take care of itself, as they showed both with the wolves and the insects. She heads of towards [Beggarsbottom](../places/beggarsbottom/story.md) as quickly as she can, taking with her a stash of [Tea of Vitality](../items/tea-of-vitality.md) for the journey. She will travel through the forest rather than the road since she knows the forest around the area and she is adept at forest travel.


| Sam Survival Rolls (x3) | Base time to Beggarsbottom                                               |
|-------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| >= 24                   | 14 + 1 hours normal = 15 hours                                           |
|                         | because of area knowledge and ability, forest is *not* difficult terrain |
|                         | so for Sam:                                                              |
|                         | 7 + 1 hours = 8 hours                                                    |
| < 24                    | add 1d6+1 hours to travel                                                |


[Sam](../characters/samantha-teastead.md) will be tired after a whole day, and now she is running throughout the night, so fatigue is settling in. She does however, drink the [Tea of Vitality](../items/tea-of-vitality.md) every hour, given her a +1 constitution.

| Sam Constitution roll (x3) | Time modifier                         |
|----------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| < 36                       | 25% more time, so 8 * 1.25 = 10 hours |
| >= 36                      | no additional time                    |


	
# The Collapse

An hour after fleeing from the goblins, about 12 midnight, [Mary](../characters/mary-tanner.md) will collapse onto the ground, unable to move. The effects of the [Potion of Cheetah's Folly](../items/potion-of-cheetas-folly.md) she drank are kicking in. She vomits up a dark green liquid and dry heaves as she lays on the ground. 

Mary rolls a wisdom check DC 15 to see if she yells at [Owlex](../characters/owlex.md) before the potion wears off or not. On fail, [Owlex](../characters/owlex.md) will fall from her shoulder. With an acrobatics or athletics check *with disadvantage* save with a DC of 10 she stumbles but lands well. On a fail she takes 1d4 bludgeon damage.

Mary: "I need to sleep, my body isn't going to move anytime soon. And you must also be fatigued." she starts to say something else but then falls deeply asleep. On a perception or medicine check of DC 10 you know she's just sleeping not unconscious.

Given the lack of animals in the forest, nothing will disturb them in their rest. With a survival check DC 15 they will even find a willow tree under which they can camp without been seen and be quite save even inside a normal, animal filled, forest.

# Mary's Wound

The party sleeps for the night, exhausted. Mary, unable to move, misses drinking her potion for illusion, and so when the morning comes, [Gustavo](../characters/gustavo.md) and [Owlex](../characters/owlex.md) see her for the first time. 

**Narrative**

Where before you saw a warrior in full armor, well used but well kept, with a mighty fortress-shield on her right hand and a short sword on her left, you now see quite a different sight. The entire right half of her armor is gone, leaving these twisted edges of torn metal. Burn marks and scorch marks seem to radiate out from the edges of the armor is a rippling wave. The metal looks like it slightly melted before cooling in a disfigured, almost melted, state that bring to mind the side of candles with the crusted, half-melted wax residue. Her entire arm is missing and you see multiple wrappings covering where her should was, around her chest, and around her rib-cage. A dark, deep purple substance seems to be slowly seeping through the bandages on her shoulder, and the rest of the wrappings you see look old and crusted with blood. You also breath in a subtle smell. A sour, foul, odor is coming from her shoulder wound underneath the dressings. Its weak but you can immediately tell that it's not the smell of bacteria or compost, but something more unpleasant. You can almost call it oily and once you detect it, the smell seems to stick with you at the back of your throat, almost refusing to leave your sinuses. You feel a little out of breath, as if what you breathed in isn't coming out and your lungs are just filling with the fragrance. A breeze filters over the forest and you feel your lungs finally clear themselves as the fresh air seems to almost wash away the sticky smell from you sinuses.

*{the smell comes from the frozen one's symbol burning off the ooze from the wound as it touches it. This vaporized ooze dissipates but you still get a whiff of it in the air.}*

Crawling up from her shoulder, you see these spidery purple tendrils that reach up the side of her neck. What had preciously looked like scar now seem almost fresh wounds, giving off a faint purple shimmer. You see a very slow, periodic dimming of the shimmer almost like the purple is sucked underneath the bandage until you can almost make yourself believe that it was just a trick of the light. But then the purple shimmer flows back through the tendrils of the wound. In and out, slowly beating a steady rhythm. 

She still has a shield on her right side, but rather than holding it you see thick leather fasteners almost gluing the shield to her side. There are large, angry, red welts from the belts, and around the places they pass over the bandages you can see a bit of brighter red blood soaking into the straps. Below the shield where you expect to see greaves you find these thin strands of metal, woven , almost artistically, around and through her right leg. The skin and the metal joining, fusing, showing what is clearly a human leg that has been essentially embossed with strands of what used to be leg armor surrounded by recent scar tissue. Her right foot is completely wrapped in dressings, but surprisingly those are the cleanest of the dressings you can see, with no obvious seepage or damage.

*{ Her foot had to be cut completely to remove a curled in piece of metal that stopped her from planting it on the ground. However, once remove and treated magically it was reattached and once again magically healed. Such a feat is actually moderately common in the frontier, and at least one experienced farmer every two or three villages knows how to do everyday animal husbandry magic to heal clean cuts of bone and tendons. Thankfully, the metal piece was a clean cut and so her foot could both be healed and reattached without issue. Of course, doing such magic drains the farmer and they usually spend at least a week gaining back their magical energy so it is only used on essential or emergency situations: such as your family member appearing on your doorstep bloodied, missing and arm, unconscious, with her armor melting into her body. }*




# The Fir Canvas

Once the morning comes, the mayor of [Fir](../places/fir.md) will gather a group of 12 mean and women to canvas the nearby forest for any signs of goblins. Their *eventual* goal is to head to where [Sam](../characters/samantha-teastead.md) had seen the goblin group, and hopefully to meetup with the party. However, their *main* concern is whether there are any monsters nearby that could harm the village, and if so to either destroy the monsters or evacuate the people of [Fir](../places/fir.md) to safety. At their current speed, the group will take the given amount of time to get within a radius of [Fir](../places/fir.md):

| hours from Fir radius | Time for Group to Check/Arrive       |
|-----------------------|--------------------------------------|
| 1                     | 3                                    |
| 2                     | 12                                   |
| 3                     | 27                                   |
| 4                     | 48                                   |
| x                     | 3 * x^2 (area of circle from radius) |
|                       |                                      |

This means that they will reach the spot where the goblins where spotted in 27 hours of searching. The group will only search during the daytime, with a separate group of 12 each day, until they get to the spot where the goblins where seen (3 hours from [Fir](../places/fir.md) for a normal person). Getting to the spot will take them 27 hours of searching, which means they will reach it 3 hours into the third day of searching (total of 51 hours passed).

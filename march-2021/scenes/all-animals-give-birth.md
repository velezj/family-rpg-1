This is the result of powerful magic enchantment breaking apart and wild magic being released from those enchantment. It is the result of the crumbling gem cage built around the heart decaying. Once weakened to a point, the cage will break down exponentially in a burst of magic. Starting with the slow drip of blood, the gems were worn away by the liquid and began cracking. Eventually, the blood dripped into the underground water table, flowing into the lake and down the rivers of southern Kryta and beyond. The blood's result are chaotic but powerful.

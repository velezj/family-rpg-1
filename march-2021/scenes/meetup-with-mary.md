title: Meeting Mary
---

[Gustavo](../characters/gustavo.md) and [Owlex](../characters/owlex.md) are traveling through to forest to get to [Fir](../places/fir.md) when they find a tree trunk down on the road and get ambushed by a set of goblins. The goblins look pretty beat up, but there are still 10 of them and will pressure the party by first trying to kill their mule and then trying to knock them down. 

During the fight, a huge heavily armed and angry Ogre shows up stomping and snarling. At the same time, a streak of light flashes as a javelin strikes the goblin leader, killing them instantly. Between the Ogre and the death of their leaders the other goblins flee. [Mary](../characters/mary-tanner.md) Tanner shows up alongside the Ogre looking fierce.

Once the goblins flee, [Mary](../characters/mary-tanner.md) will bend down in exhaustion. She will pick up her card-of-illusion which made the Ogre (an illusion). [Mary](../characters/mary-tanner.md) will look over [Gustavo](../characters/gustavo.md) and [Owlex](../characters/owlex.md), along with their cart, and ask where are they headed. She quickly realizes that these two kids are in over their head out in the world. She will assert to go with them.

During the whole time [Mary](../characters/mary-tanner.md) is with [Gustavo](../characters/gustavo.md) and [Owlex](../characters/owlex.md), she will have her shield on her right arm, mounted in such a way that it looks likes her armored arm is holding it. Really, it is fastened as well as the armor arm since her whole arm is missing and bandaged underneath.

The woman stands next to the Ogre, her sword ready and her eyes scanning the forest for any sign of goblins. After a quick scan, she lowers her sword and bends down to pick up something from the ground. As quickly as the Ogre appeared, it disappeared. The woman finally looks at the two. "You okay?" As she waits for an answer her shoulders slump down a bit. Your hands and body are still shaking, the adrenaline still causing your senses to waver between focused sharp and a jittery mess. A few breath later you look at the woman and take time to really see her. She's wearing a cloak over chain armor, both of which look heavily used but also quite well taken care of. The woman pulls down her deep hood, revealing a relatively serious looking face. Straight cheekbones surround deep set eyes with thick eyebrows. Close crop black hair fall down to her neck is a simple bob cut. Right now her lips are pressed into a sort-of smile. The right side of her face has a dark red scar running down towards the neck. It's a deep almost-purple color making you wonder if it is actually a tattoo rather than a scar. 

On her right she's carrying a large shield that looks like it has seen better days. The shield looks in worse shape than the rest of her armor or clothes. The woman starts walking towards you. As she gets closer you can see that she looks pretty exhausted. What you thought at first to be a chiseled face now looks more like sunken muscles stretched over the cheekbones. Her walks starts as a fierce stride but quickly turns into a somewhat weary amble as she gets near. "Where are you headed? This way is [Fir](../places/fir.md)" she says as she points behind her. "I'm headed that way ..." She looks over at your horse and cart. "Goblins usually don't come through here so close to the road. An not in such numbers... " she seems to ponder the ambush. "... My name is [Mary Tanner](../characters/mary-tanner.md), would you like to travel with me to [Fir](../places/fir.md)? ... there's safety in numbers, although I doubt those goblins will be back anytime tonight ... at the end of the day goblins are cowards and once their leader is gone they'll want to flee and try for easier prey." As she says this she starts slowly walking over to the corpse of the goblin leader. She bends down and starts rummaging through the corpse with practiced movement. It's almost automatic as you see her eyes go a bit unfocused. She pulls out a dirty pouch and stores it under he cloak, then begins to inspect a the sword and bow used by the leader, finally deciding to take the sword under her cloak as well. With two swift, practiced movements she cuts off the ears and stores them under her cloak. The sounds of the forest return as the Ogre's yells are forgotten.

If you decide to travel with [Mary](../characters/mary-tanner.md) your place will be slower. You mule will also be tired. Once evening comes you will be about 3 hours away from [Fir](../places/fir.md) by your best guess (at least [Mary's](../characters/mary-tanner.md) guess).

If you do not travel with [Mary](../characters/mary-tanner.md) you will be about 1 hour away when evening comes.

If you choose to hurry onward make a survival check (DC 12) to see how well you can travel in the dark. One a success you get to [Fir](../places/fir.md) uneventfully, otherwise you will take 3 hours to get to [Fir](../places/fir.md) and will hurt your Mule's foot so that it needs to heal and goes slower the next day.

If you choose to make camp, [Mary](../characters/mary-tanner.md) will find a campsite. Make a survival check (DC 8) to see how well the campsite is. During camp, [Mary](../characters/mary-tanner.md) will take out a tiny pouch and takes a pinch of something from it, putting it on the food being made. It tastes amazing, and like nothing you have tasted before. It's the spice rosemary which is not found around here. [Mary](../characters/mary-tanner.md) will start speaking during dinner. "So ... what's your story kids? .... you look like you're farm-folks, am I right? What made you decide to travel through the forest and to [Fir](../places/fir.md)?"

[Mary](../characters/mary-tanner.md) will ask about their reasons and will say that she herself is returning to [Beggarsbottom](../places/beggarsbottom.md) from home. She lives in near a small village south of here called [Gade](../places/gade.md). Make a history check (DC 10) to see if you recognize the name.

Gustavo and Owlex are traveling through to forest to get to Fir when they find a tree trunk down on the road and get ambushed by a set of goblins. The goblins look pretty beat up, but there are still 10 of them and will pressure the party by first trying to kill their mule and then trying to knock them down. 

During the fight, a huge heavily armed and angry Ogre shows up stomping and snarling. At the same time, a streak of light flashes as a javelin strikes the goblin leader, killing them instantly. Between the Ogre and the death of their leaders the other goblins flee. Mary Tanner shows up alongside the Ogre looking fierce.

Once the goblins flee, Mary will bend down in exhaustion. She will pick up her card-of-illusion which made the Ogre (an illusion). Mary will look over Gustavo and Owlex, along with their cart, and ask where are they headed. She quickly realizes that these two kids are in over their head out in the world. She will assert to go with them.

During the whole time Mary is with Gustavo and Owlex, she will have her shield on her right arm, mounted in such a way that it looks likes her armored arm is holding it. Really, it is fastened as well as the armor arm since her whole arm is missing and bandaged underneath.

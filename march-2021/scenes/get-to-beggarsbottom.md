Mary, Owlex, and Gustavo start heading on to Fir. There is only the single mule between all of them. If Mary is walking she will be half-speed, otherwise they will be at walking speed. During the travel Mary will ask them questions and will reply with part of the story:

- Talk about the Demon Lord (includes a general overview of demons and Kryta)	
- Talk about heading over to fight the demon lord (generals)
- She will deflect about her health and scar (will try to hide it as much as possible)
- She will call herself an adventurer and describe some of what adventurers do
- She will explain some general Kryta history and how this region is basically the frontier

title: Get to Beggarsbottom
---

[Mary](../characters/mary-tanner.md), [Owlex](../characters/owlex.md), and Gustavo start heading on to [Beggarsbottom](../places/beggarsbottom/story.md). There is only the single mule between all of them. If [Mary](../characters/mary-tanner.md) is walking she will be half-speed, otherwise they will be at walking speed. During the travel she will ask them questions and will reply with part of the story:

- Talk about the Demon Lord (includes a general overview of demons and Kryta)	
- Talk about heading over to fight the demon lord (generals)
- She will deflect about her health and scar (will try to hide it as much as possible)
- She will call herself an adventurer and describe some of what adventurers do
- She will explain some general Kryta history and how this region is basically the frontier

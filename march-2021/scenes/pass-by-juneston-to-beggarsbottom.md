title: Pass by Juneston on the Way to Beggarsbottom
---

While the party travels to [Beggarsbottom](../places/beggarsbottom/story.md) they will pass through [Juneston](../places/juneston.md). [Mary](../characters/mary-tanner.md) will want this to be a short stop.

Mary:
"We'll get to [Juneston](../places/juneston.md) soon. It'll feel a little closer to your village I think. It's a community for local farmers so they cater mostly to their own. But there's enough travelers that they're not suspicious of them. Most of the travel through the forest comes by way of [Cairston](../places/cairston.md) north of here and [Fir](../places/fir.md), so [Juneston](../places/juneston.md) mostly gets people who live and work around this part of southern Kryta. " She'll look at the other party members and herself. "The tavern's food is pretty good and they have rooms to stay. Last time I got some rooms .... it was 5 SP per night. Pretty simple rooms but functional ... but to be frank, I'm ready to reach [Beggarsbottom](../places/beggarsbottom/story.md) as soon as I can ... it's been a longer and rougher journey than I expected and I'm grateful for both company and this wagon" she smiles wryly, "And I know you to are light on coin so you probably want to camp out rather than get a room. I propose the following: let us travel together to [Beggarsbottom](../places/beggarsbottom/story.md) without stopping at towns. Once there, we can decide what to do. Sound good?"

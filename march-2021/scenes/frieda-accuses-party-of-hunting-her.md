After noticing the aura of the Fey surrounding the party when she saw them in front of the closed Adventurers Guild, Frieda decides to meet them head on. Or rather, by taking one of the party as hostage and interrogating them about why they are following her and what they want.

# Goals for Frieda

- Stop Fey, and mostly Elorin, from finding her and getting her back
- Find out why party has Fey presence
- Find out about Frozen One
- Stay out of trouble
- safety in numbers

# Narrative

*{ this happens after Frieda has either succeeded or failed at taking one of you "hostage" wither by sneaking in to the guild or ambushing you as you are walking to/from guild and Beggarsbottom }*

Freida: "So! You found me, you caught me ... what does [Elorin](../characters/elorin.md) want?!? ... I'm done with them, done with the House of Elorin ... and now what? .... they want me back? did they finally wake up and realize the state the house was in? ... did they find themselves bored after I left?." with a fiery expression on her face, Frieda wills each of you to look into her eyes as she asks you her questions.

*{ if she's being held, she will struggle a bit as she is saying this }*

**in reply to party saying they have no idea what she's talking about**
"Right ... sure .... and that stench of the Fey just happens to surround your party? ... or you "just happened" to be in town when I was in town? ..... how *did* you find me anyway? ... tacking spells? did Elorin put a tracker on me? .... you might as well tell me, I'm not going to let you track me again!

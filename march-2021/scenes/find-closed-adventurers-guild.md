title: Find Closed Adventurer's Guild
---

[Mary](../characters/mary-tanner.md), [Gustavo](../characters/gustavo.md), and [Owlex](../characters/owlex.md) get to the [adventurer's guild](../places/adventurers-guild.md) in [Beggarsbottom](../places/beggarsbottom/story.md). They find the guild empty and closed for new members. The guild person inside will tell them about the call given to all guilds to help with the [Demon Lord](../setting-world/demon-lord.md). 

- Kryta has called to all adventurer guilds to send able adventurer's (level 5 or higher) to help fight the [Demon Lord](../setting-world/demon-lord.md) armies. All of the members of this guild left for this. They ended up taking their low-level members to give them experience.

At this point, [Mary](../characters/mary-tanner.md) suggests that they come talk to the guild she belongs to which is another place for adventurers. She will let [Garth](../characters/garth-ven.md) explain the details of what exactly the guild does.

title: Find Closed Adventurer's Guild
---

Mary, Gustavo, and Owlex get to the adventurer's guild in Beggarsbottom. They find the guild empty and closed for new members. The guild person inside will tell them about the call given to all guilds to help with the demon lord. 

- Kryta has called to all Adventurer Guilds to send able adventurer's (level 5 or higher) to help fight the Demon Lord armies. All of the members of this guild left for this. They ended up taking their low-level members to give them experience.

At this point, Mary suggests that they come talk to the guild she belongs to which is another place for adventurers. She will let Garth explain the details of what exactly the guild does.

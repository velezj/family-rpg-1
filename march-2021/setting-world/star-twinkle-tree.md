The Star Twinkle trees are magical trees that grow across the world of Cloven. They are drawn and germinate only around dense concentrations of magical energy. The trees, once grown, seem to slowly siphon and stabilize the energy around them, mildly lowering the concentration but seeming to be able to regenerate the energy is used or consumed by other beings. The trees are also known to providing areas around which various rare and magical herbs grow. Herbalists dream of one day finding a Star Twinkle tree of their own to provide a steady supply of rare herbs.

In reality, the Star Twinkle trees are *not* different trees but are a single tree that exists both in the material plane and the Feywilds. The material plane projections of the great Star Twinkle tree appear within high magical areas. It is not known what of why the Star Twinkle Tree exists, and even the Fey tread carefully around it.

At some point in the past, a house of Quicklings became entangled with the great tree, their essence and memory fused with that of the tree in the Feywilds. Since, the house of Linedamoor has protected the tree as their entire house is tied to it.

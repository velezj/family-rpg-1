The party is not just a "random" set of adventurers, but rather a selected chosen to challenge and contain The Outsider.

The Fey will recognize the "patrons" of the party as such:
- The Frozen One -> The Calm
- The Wolf Spirit -> The Wolf
- The Fey Queens -> The Queens of Summer and Winter

# Mary Tanner

Marked by The Frozen One, they have already protected Mary during her fight with the Demon General. She is the envoy sent by the Celestials to champion their cause against The Outsider. She does not know this yet.

**if killed**
Mary has already been marked by The Frozen One and so has had her life force stilled. She will never truly die until The Frozen One is done with her.

# Owlex

Chosen as the representative for the material plane, Owlex has already met and communed with the Spirit of the Wolf.

**if killed**
The Spirit of the Wolf will break off one of it's fangs and embed it into Owlex's heart. There, the fang will let her live once again, although she is not both halfling and plant. The fang is still physically embedded in her heart, and her very nature has changed so that her heart does not beat but rather her blood circulates like sap. Other changes may become apparent as the effects of fusing with plants has not been explored before.

# Gustavo

When the Fey bargained with the Demon Lord, the Queens of Summer and Winter scattered seeds of power onto creatures that were not part of the Fey but could act as agents of the Fey in the coming battle. While "technically" neutral, both queens understand that a world where the Demons win the war and bring forth The Outsider is not a world kind to the Fey.

Out of the many seeds, Gustavo's is the only creature to bloom into power, manifested as his magical ability. The other seeds seem to have been purposely eliminated by an unknown group. By virtue of being born in the frontier of Kryta and by his humble beginnings, Gustavo has survived unnoticed and has finally begun to grow into this power granted  by the queens. However, the Fey never grant a boon without also getting something in return. Gustavo does not know he has this seed, not understands the results of having both Summer and Winter queens interesting in him.

**if killed**
The queens will reward Ftata for a fortunate and coincidental mark connecting their family and Gustavo. The queens will grant Gustavo with a Winter Eye and a Summer Eye (given in a painful way by gouging out his eyes with their thumbs). Furthermore, the Winter Queen will give Gustavo the ability to use Eldritch Blast and Hex. The Summer Queen will bestow onto Gustavo's Familiar the ability to grow with him. Gustavo's Familiar has a CR of 1/4 of Gustavo's Level, hence can grow stronger as Gustavo grows in levels. The eyes are connected to the queens, and each can seen through them at will. Gustavo can also be located and tracked at will by the queens. Further, Gustavo's true-name has been altered by the queens, and each has learned a different half of his name. Together, the queens know his true-name and can use this knowledge. 

The Winter Eye allows Gustavo to cast "Detect Magic" at will without using a spell slot and makes Gustavo become a Level 1 Warlock (Archfey patron). The two cantrips must be "Eldritch Blast" and "Hex".

The Summer Eye gives Gustavo darkvision 120 ft. and allows Gustavo to cast "Detect Good and Evil" and "Detect Poison and Disease" at will without using a spell slot.

Gustavo's left eye becomes silver and shines with fay energy. Sparkles of Fey energy can be seen tracing around the pupil and with a DC 20 perception the mark of the Winter Queen can be seen in the depths of the pupil. Similarly, Gustavo's right eye becomes golden and can be seen faintly shining even through his eyelids. Both the whites and iris of the eye shimmer in a golden color. On a DC 20 check, you can see the mark of the Summer Queen in the depths of the pupil.

# Cloven: The World

The world of Cloven is a small world mostly covered with water. Intelligent life exists within a small northern region of Cloven, centerd around two large continents: Gallar and Admor. Ther are several outlying islands that also show signs of intelligent life.  The seas of Cloven are full of life. UNlike Earth, the food ecosystem of Cloven originates with hot, acrid steam vents on hte ocean's floor that gush out minerals and chemicals that are further processed by microbial life. Form there, small to mesium arthropods build up the lowest level of the food chain, as well as the lowest depths of the ocean. The major sea life consists of Cephalopods of all types, sizes, and personalities. There is even a conjecture among the intelligent life that some of these sea creatures contains levels of intelligence, perhaps even being the most intelligent life in the world. Howver, little is actually known about the sea life of Cloven, due to the land-faring residents having very little ability to explore the seas beyond a few meters from land.


# History

Ancient history of the creation of Cloven has mostly been lost and remains as myths and cultoral stories handed down the generations. It is consitently thought, however, that at some point in the past the world of Cloven was completely covers by oceans. From these oceans of pre-history rose up the continents of Gallar and Admor along with a few speckled islands. Researchers call the creation of the continents "The Fall". It is theorized that a magnificent comet struck Cloven. The force of the impact caused a shift to the world's tectonic plates, pushing up the seafloor to create the continents above water. What is true is that the current life on land depends on the power of the sun, rather than the minerals from the depths. Plantlife supports all life outside of the oceans, becoming the bedrock of the species that no longer live in the water. This has lead to a full dichotomy between the ecology of the sea and teh ecology of the land. Plants only appear on land while Cephalopods and their descendants are only found in the water; therefore no snails or slugs are found on land.

During the time right after The Fall, it is believed that the races came to be. Current scientific research has yet to focus endeavours to fossil records so little is known about the evolution of the races beyond folkwtails told by each culture. What is known is the first came the Races of the Dawn: elves, dwarfs, humans, half-lings and all races considered "pure" (including animals).

While all races of the Dawn have thier individual culture and traditions, every single Dawn race includes the doctrine of The Divide. During the dawn of the world, the Races of the Dawn lived in peace. However, a calamity befell the world of Cloven: the rise of the Monsters. An evil seeped into the world, causing some of the individuals of every race to change in both physical and emotional ways. These mutated individuals grew larger and more robust. Horns, teeth, and all maner of weaponry and defenses appeared on the changed individuals. No matter what physical changes appeared, the emotional changes were perhaps more severe: Increased aggression, an unsatiable appetite, and a fierce hatred of the non-Awakened. These changed individuals became progenators for all monsters found today. We call all such creatures Monsters to separeted them from the races of the Dawn. Little is currently known about The Divide. Why? How? No-one in the races of the Dawn is certain. Since thier appearance, the monsters have fought and battled with the races of the Dawn. Neither side can claim victory. However changed the Monsters are, some retain the ability to mate with the races of the Dawn. The children of such pairings are fated to choose: Succumb to the monster within, or continue shining the light of the Dawn to those around them. 

## Celestial 

Along with the history of the races, there exists the history of the Celestial. These beings have transcended physical form and travel from planet to planet. Several Celestial have made Cloven their home, tired after millennia of wanderlust. The life of Cloven has, over the centuries, started to be able to communicate with these beings. Weather from boredom, pride, or simple whim, these Celestial allow individuals to harness their power to performs feats of magic and miracle within Cloven.

## Hidden History

These events are known to only a few celestial beings.

The Fall was created by a meteor hitting Cloven and bringing up the land as theorized. However, the meteorite was covered with life, specifically that life with photosynthesis receptors. All life on land evolved from this extra-terrestrial life brought into Cloven. 

The Divide was created by the dissipation of the Celestial Liy, who traveled to Cloven as their final journey. Their energy spread throughout Clover. Those individuals with high empathy, sensitive to the presence of the Celestial beings felt the dissipation. The onslaught of energy caused the mental and physical forms of those individuals to change. They went mad, their minds shattered by the smallest of brushes with the Celestial energy. This unintended consequence caught the attention of a few of the resident Celestial, who took a mild interest in the life now growing on Cloven and began to communicate with the life. Thus began the ability to harness a Celestial energy.

Sometimes, a Demon is born that can command the horde of full demons. This power unites the demons under a single leader, and will gather monsters to the leader's call.

The last Demon Lord appeared 3000 years ago and almost wiped out the races of the Dawn living in Gallar.

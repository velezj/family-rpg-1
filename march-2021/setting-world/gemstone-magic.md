# Summary

Spells and magical formulae can be inscribed into gems. These gems can also be imprinted with magical power or can be used to store magical power. High-level Materialologists can create magical objects that behave when activated and can even be control by non-magical beings.

# Gems and Crystal

Gems and materials used for gemstone magic have three main attributes:

- level
- quality (1 - 100)
- crystal type (base level)

## Crystal Level

The level for a crystal determines the maximum amount and power of formulae that can be imbued into the material. The *total* number of spell levels that can be imbued into a crystal is equal to it's *level* + "base level* (derived from type). The higher the level, the higher the number and/or level of spell able to be used.

## Crystal Quality

The quality of a crystal determines how easy it is to imbue the crystal with formulae. The higher the quality, the easier it is to store magic and manipulate it using the crystal.

## Crystal Type

The type of crystal determines a fundamental *base level* for the material. This base level, along with the crystal's level, is used to determine how many spell levels can be stored into the crystal: (base level) + level.

# Crafting and Creation

To imbue a spell onto a crystal, you must first etch the formulae into the crystal structure. Make a Dexterity (Etching) ability check with a DC or 15 + spell level trying to be used. On a success, you have successfully etched the formulae into the crystal. If the crystal already has a spell/formulae make this check with disadvantage.

Then you must roll a d100 to see if the crystal accepts the formulae. If the result is <= quality of the crystal, the crystal stabilizes the formulae internally without breaking, otherwise the crystal cracks under the stress of fusing with the formulae and is unusable for formulae.

The Fey exist at the intersection of the material plane and another plane they call home. Able to move between the two, they are often found unexpectedly and lost just as suddenly. Their minds are incomprehensible to other races, their thoughts and actions alien to the grounded reasoning etched into the material plane. But make no mistake, the Fey are powerful allies and even stronger enemies. Tread lightly.


# Fey Hierarchy

Two courts: Summer Court and Winter Court.

**court structure (both courts)**
- Mother: top-most matriarch
  - concerned with universe-level events within future and past timelines. 
  - near impossible to meet (even for fey)
  - completely foreign point of view
  - powerful but concerned mostly with fate of groups not individuals

- Queen: top functional matriarch
  - leads the fey court, actively
  - most powerful fey followed by all others in court
  - powerful enough that non-fey and low-level fey have trouble being near their presence
  - looks out for their court *and* the balance between courts
  - All but the most powerful fey of other courts will follow their commands
  - embodiment of the court's ideals 

- Lady: queen's successor in training
  - often given important tasks directly from the queen
  - able to command most fey except those high up in their own court

- Knight: chosen warrior of the court
  - sent to handle "tricky" situations between the court and the rest of the world
  - extremely powerful (usually more so than the lady)
  - follows the Lady and the Queen
  - has general freedom to handle situations as they seem fit
  - recognized by all fey, regardless of court, and a champion for the fey

- Summer Mother: Nameless
- Summer Queen: Titania

# Summer Court

The Summer Court is led by Queen Titania. She is a tall, regal queen whose sense of beauty surpasses even those of the celestial. This drives the Summer Court towards a single-minded pursuit of ideals, beauty, and harmony. Anything that causes sadness, discomfort, or awkwardness is viewed as a personal affront to the Queen. 

The current Summer Court is known for lavish parties full of entertained, laughter, and a purposeful merrymaking. Queen Titania has entrusted the mood of the court to the Summer Lady Alerin. All must be beautify in front of the Queen. Together with the Summer Knight Valerian, Alerin handles the backroom deals and "annoyances" that would ruin the mood of the Summer Queen with a subtle intelligence and a deft use of power, manipulation, and personnel. 

## Summer Queen Titania

Standing at just below seven feet, Summer Queen Titania wears simple one-piece dresses that accentuate her elegance and complements her regal bearing.

## Summer Lady Alerin

## Summer Knight Valerian

# Winter Court

The Winter Court is led by the Winter Queen Mab. She stands just over four feet in height and would normally be overlooked as a frail nobody. However, her harsh eyes betray her spine chilling power. Most often enveloped by shimmer jewels and ice crystals, the Winter Queen moves where her whims take her. She is both intelligent and arrogant, willing to join coalitions when needed, and even more willing to destroy them for her own gain. Ruthless, harsh, fearsome, and ultimately in control, the Winter Queen Mab is one of the most vicious and dangerous creatures one can come across.

Winter Queen Mab rules the Winter Court ruthlessly. Power and efficiency are rewarded; weakness is uprooted and discarded as inefficient trash. The Winter Knight is her method of choice to "re-educate" fey that have disappointed the court. As apposed to the Summer Lady, the Winter Lady Lexia is left to decided her own fate. She is judged by the Winter Queen even more harshly than other fey as Lexia is in training to be the next Winter Queen.

The Fey exist at the intersection of the material plane and another plane they call home. Able to move between the two, they are often found unexpectedly and lost just as suddenly. Their minds are incomprehensible to other races, their thoughts and actions alien to the grounded reasoning etched into the material plane. But make no mistake, the Fey are powerful allies and even stronger enemies. Tread lightly.

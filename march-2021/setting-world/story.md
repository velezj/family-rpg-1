# Events prior / background

- The Demon Lord has awakened! Thousands of beasts are gathering around the new Demon Lord, uniting the monster tribes into a massive horde. Humans, elves, and dwarfs have started to muster their armies for the inevitable war. No-one yet knows the first target for the Demon Lord's army. Countries are trying to wade through age-old mistrust in order to create an an army for the civilized world.

- Adventurers from all over the kingdom of Kryta are gathering at the capitol Metrun, seeking riches and glory in the upcoming conflict with the Demon Horde.

- Skirmishes have already started as the presence of at least 3 great Demon Lord Generals has been confirmed. The Demon Lord General Tilhorn has it's sight set on Kryta and has started to coalesce the monsters near the region. This has caused an upheaval of the monsters within the kingdom, mostly near the capital of Metrun. All adventurer guilds within the kingdom have been asked to supply help dealing with the newly incited monsters appearing near the capitol. Heroes are born every day.

- In the rural town of Beggarbottom, near the borderlands between Kryta and the Wildwood, the adventurer guild has responded to the call for members to join the Kryta forces at the capitol. All able adventurers from the guild have left for the capitol. The guild hall lies empty; guild workers lay about with nothing to do. A sign hangs from the door: "Not accepting new quests due to lack of adventurers."

- The Outsider has poisoned the mind of the Demon Lord (when the dmon lord was just a child), using the Demon Lord's psychic abilities to bend him to The Outsider's will.

- The Outsider has power related to shadows and other planes since it was originally a celestial. It is in a sense a shadow of the celestial. It's body has been scattered across the world. However, it is still alive and blood is still pumping, the parts behaving as if they were together as a whole even over long distances.

- The first target for The Outsider are the Fey. They are already not entirely from the material plane. This means that they have a greater chance to mess with The Outsider or its plans. Using the demons and its magic, the Fey were forced to make a pact: they would not interfere with the Demon Lord's war that was about to start (the Fey do not yet know of The Outsider or its control over the Demon Lord).

- The Fey are always truthful and will not break the pack. However, the two queens of Summer and Winter found a loophole. They scattered across the material plane several "seeds" of Fey powers to newborns. These seeds are the core of Fey that volunteered to be merged with another creature. These mergers are not Fey themselves, and hence do *not* have to follow the pact. The queens hoped that the seeds would grow into a strong force against the Demons

- However, The Outsider noticed these seeds and, together with the Demon Lord and his generals, cast a ritual to find all such seed individuals and bring them to The Outsider's resting place deep in the ocean floor. The, The Outsider can rule shadows to dispose of the seeds in a way that the power is completely destroyed. The ritual created hunter shadows which walk the world looking for signatures of these seeds.

- Of course, the Fey queens tried to hide the seeds, even from the individuals themselves. The hunter shadows need to be relatively close (within 1km) of a seed to sense it. Or the seed must make a connections to a larger group; this connection can be used by the shadows to locate the seed.

- The Outsider forms a pact with Ernstyn. His job is to make sure its plan goes smoothly. He is in particular told to make sure no pesky planar guardians get in the way of The Outsider.

- After the ritual for finding the seeds, much of The Outsider's power has been spent and it has to recuperate over time. This means that most of the plan is now in the hands of his subordinates: The Demon Lord and Ernstyn.

- Mary was a great sword user, a two handed magical sword was her most prized possession. She comes back without her arm and with her sword broken in half and cracked throughout. She can not longer fight with her weapon. She must re-train to be a warrior. He body is that of a high-level adventurer, but her skills and fighting prowess are back those of a school-yard thug.


# Events at start

- Two friends from the village of Splurt (a tiny village) head to the "big city" (Beggarsbottom) in order to start their life under their own power. They both dream of a life outside of farming and have decided to go out into the world and make it on their own. The friends are called A and B.

- On their way to Beggarsbottom, the friends get attacked by a band of goblins? A single goblin, or maybe two together, would not be a problem for the friends. But a whole band is too much. Just as their luck would seem to have run out, a woman appears on the road and defeats the leader. Seeing their leader struck down so quickly, the rest of the goblins flee the area, leaving the two friends alive and indebted to the female warrior: Mary Tanner.

- Mary Tanner decides to join the friends on their way to Beggarsbottom, it is where she herself was going to. Along the way, she asks about where they would sleep and stay in the town. Mary quickly realizes that the two friends are naive and do not know how this world works and have no clear plan for their future. She decides to let them stay where she is staying, the "other" adventurer guild. She guides them there where the friends meet Garth and are allowed to stay in the guild hall during the nights and pay, cheaply, for food from the hall as well.

- In the town of Fir, the party helps guard the local herbalist Samantha as she gathers herbs in the forest. However, the forest is strange, with very little animals. 

- While gathering, the party comes across a Quickling Fey protecting a Star Twinkle Tree. The party ends up making a blood pact (unknown to them) to protect the tree. The next morning all of the party's fingers the symbol of the blood pact with the Fey.

- They then encounter a group of goblins and others deep in the forest with materials for construction.

- The party splits, with Sam heading back to Fir to tell the mayor of hte goblins and Owlex, Gustavo, and Mary tracking the goblin group. They ere found out and owlex was heavily injured.

- With the help of Mary, and a potion of Cheetah's Folly, they manage to loose the goblin group. However, they did not know exactly where they were in the forest. Mary faints from fatigue. After she wakes up, she shows the party her missing arm and scar and gives a brief explanation of what happened: a demon general hit her, she barely escaped alive.

- The party, minus Sam, head to Beggarsbottom. On the way they encounter a strange beast and a strange individual fighting it. They help fight off the beast which is then burned by hte individual before they disappear back into the forest. They also encounter a strange tale of "Old Man Willy" and mushrooms. The party also helps kill a monster that was attacking and eating farmer's cows.

- In Beggarsbottom they learn that the guild is closed.

- The friends, awed by Mary and reassured by Garth, decide to join the guild and become adventurers themselves.

- Mary Tanner has just returned from the war. She fought, and completely lost, to the Demon Lord Tilhorn, barely avoiding death but losing her arm at the shoulder. Her bandaged arm is slowly healing, still bandaged. She returned to he guild (Garth's guild) full of regret, embarrassment, and hopelessness: she was not good enough as an adventurer, a failure.  At the guild she sleeps and lounges around, loafing listlessly. Garth is concerned, and the two friends try to grasp how the warrior that saved them is the same as this slovenly lump withering away at the guild hall.


- Gustavo becomes Garth's apprentice and Owlex becomes Mary's apprentice. Gustavo's connection of master and apprentice triggers a magic cast by The Outsider (with help of demons and such) to find and teleport those which are "seeds" planted by the Fey.

- Gustavo's apprenticeship to Garth creates a connection the is sensed by the hunter shadows. Following the sent, the shadows attempt to bring the party, *including Sam* because of the blood pact, to The Outsider. However, Garth's defenses around the Other Guild are string and only their spirit is brought to The Outsider, their body stopped by a dome-shape shield surrounding the guild.

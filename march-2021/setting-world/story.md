# Events prior / background

- The Demon Lord has awakened! Thousands of beasts are gathering around the new Demon Lord, uniting the monster tribes into a massive horde. Humans, elves, and dwarfs have started to muster their armies for the inevitable war. No-one yet knows the first target for the Demon Lord's army. Countries are trying to wade through age-old mistrust in order to create an an army for the civilized world.

- Adventurers from all over the kingdom of Kryta are gathering at the capitol Metrun, seeking riches and glory in the upcoming conflict with the Demon Horde.

- Skirmishes have already started as the presence of at least 3 great Demon Lord Generals has been confirmed. The Demon Lord General Tilhorn has it's sight set on Kryta and has started to coalesce the monsters near the region. This has caused an upheaval of the monsters within the kingdom, mostly near the capital of Metrun. All adventurer guilds within the kingdom have been asked to supply help dealing with the newly incited monsters appearing near the capitol. Heroes are born every day.

- In the rural town of Beggarspuddle, near the borderlands between Kryta and the Wildwood, the adventurer guild has responded to the call for members to join the Kryta forces at the capitol. All able adventurers from the guild have left for the capitol. The guild hall lies empty; guild workers lay about with nothing to do. A sign hangs from the door: "Not accepting new quests due to lack of adventurers."

# Events at start

- Two friends from the village of Splurt (a tiny village) head to the "big city" (Beggarspuddle) in order to start their life under their own power. They both dream of a life outside of farming and have decided to go out into the world and make it on their own. The friends are called A and B.

- On their way to Beggarspuddle, the friends get attacked by a band of orcs? A single orc, or maybe two together, would not be a problem for the friends. But a whole band is too much. Just as their luck would seem to have run out, a woman appears on the road and defeats the orc leader along with several of the orcs. Seeing their leader struck down so quickly, the rest of the orcs flee the area, leaving the two friends alive and indebted to the female warrior: Mary Tanner.

- Mary Tanner decides to join the friends on their way to Beggarspuddle, it is where she herself was going to. Along the way, she asks about where they would sleep and stay in the town. Mary quickly realizes that the two friends are naive and do not know how this world works and have no clear plan for their future. She decides to let them stay where she is staying, the "other" adventurer guild. She guides them there where the friends meet Garth and are allowed to stay in the guild hall during the nights and pay, cheaply, for food from the hall as well.

- The friends, awed by Mary and reassured by Garth, decide to join the guild and become adventurers themselves.

- Mary Tanner has just returned from the war. She fought, and completely lost, to the Demon Lord Tilhorn, barely avoiding death but losing her arm at the shoulder. Her bandaged arm is slowly healing, still bandaged. She returned to he guild (Garth's guild) full of regret, embarrassment, and hopelessness: she was not good enough as an adventurer, a failure.  At the guild she sleeps and lounges around, loafing listlessly. Garth is concerned, and the two friends try to grasp how the warrior that saved them is the same as this slovenly lump withering away at the guild hall.

- A quest comes in from a nearby town/village: their sewer system must be cleaned of rats/vermin. If pressed, the giver will admit that a previous party of adventurers from the adventurers guild (not the other guild) have not returned from the quest. The previous party was 4 completely new adventurers that were not able to go the the capital with the rest of their guild.

- Garth pressures Mary to go with the two friends on the quest. She needs to get out and move her body. She also needs to remember that adventurers are there to help people, not just fight Demons.

- The three adventurers, two newly minted, head out to clean the sewers. Little did they know that a far greater threat to the region was awakened and they were the only adventurers around to deal with it.

- Mary was a great sword user, a two handed magical sword was her most prized possession. She comes back without her arm and with her sword broken in half and cracked throughout. She can not longer fight with her weapon. She brings with he a short sword and must re-train to be a warrior with it. He body is that of a high-level adventurer, but her skills and fighting prowess are back those of a school-yard thug with a sword. Thus the three head over to clean some sewers.

# Possible Events

- Meet the ratfolk which have been tracking teh mutations/monsters in the sewers from *their* town over to the current sewers. They will join the party and help explore what is going on if the party is willing to help their village when the source is discovered.

- bring back sewer remains of mutated worms/rats to Garth. He will suggest ot take them to Rosaline Cotswad and will go with party. Her father was a friend of Garth's and she is like a niece to Garth.

The Frozen One is a [Celestial](../setting-world/celestials.md) associated with stillness, calmness, and peace.

# Characteristics 

While many believe the Frozen One to be agnostic to the world, or even dangerous to the races of the dawn, this is not true. As there is a beginning to all things, so there must be an end. The Frozen One pays attention to these endings, ensuring that proper and peaceful stillness results from an ending. All creatures are treated as equal by the Frozen One; no one is above peace and calmness. A single individual is just as important as the whole world. At the end, all will be at peace; still and calm.

The single most perverse action against the Frozen One is the creation and upkeep of the un-dead. The domain beyond the grave is the purview of the Frozen One, and the un-dead are a blight that prevents the true stillness from enveloping a soul after death. Such perversions cause an imbalance in the world.

The Frozen One rarely speaks to creatures, preferring to guide the world using imagery and metaphor. The Frozen One values peace and calmness above everything else.

# Historic Events

Throughout history, very little is known or recorded about the Frozen One. It is a mysterious celestial that often works from the shadows to support and balance the world. 

# Interactions with Individuals

A scattering of people throughout history have ever been contacted by, or spoken to, the Frozen One. While other celestials value the community and the power of groups, the Frozen One chooses a single, solitary figure to act as a fulcrum, tipping the world back into balance with a few, precise, actions. Once a being has been chosen by the Frozen One, their internal state is just as important as their actions. The Frozen One believes that the peace of an individual is just as important as the peace of the world.

# Sects

### The Glittering One

A secret sect following the guidance and tenants of the Frozen One. This is less of a religious group and more of a duty-bound line of warriors trying handle the results of [The Fall](../setting-world/world.md). The group is led by [Sheem](../characters/sheem.md), a re-incarnated being whose memories date to before [The Fall](../setting-world/world.md). The soul of [Sheem](../characters/sheem.md) has been reborn countless times, and will continue to be reborn after each body dies, until the fallout from [The Fall](../setting-world/world.md) has been dealt with and calmness is restored to the world.

### The Circle of Bones

A sect of individuals that use the perverted magics of necromancy to undo the stain of the un-dead. This group takes *willing* souls to create warriors to fight and destroy the un-dead and nay necromancers around. The souls are used for a specific amount of time, no more that a single year, and are then returned to the stillness of the Frozen One. As with the Glittering Ones, the followers treat the Frozen One as a general rather than a deity to be worshiped. Stillness is the master, the Frozen One is simply the one who shows the world.

# People of Interest

### Sheem

A soul that will re-incarnate until the problems of [The Fall](../setting-world/world.md) are handled. The leader of the Glittering Ones. Sheem and the Frozen One together created a pact of mutual understanding: [The Fall](../setting-world/world.md) is a perversion that thrust the world into chaos, it must be stilled in order to balance the world.

# Goals

- To ensure that all returns to peace and stillness

- To keep the world in balance and ensure that all things that start must also end

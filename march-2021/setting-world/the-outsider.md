A piece of [Jantrea](../setting-world/celestials.md) shed during the transcendence, The Outsider is the definitive cause of [The Fall](../setting-world/world.md). Almost all knowledge of The Outsider, and [The Fall](../setting-world/world.md), has been lost to the races of today. But the reach of The Outsider was only tempered after [The Fall](../setting-world/world.md), not contained.


# Inside Knowledge

A band of mages, druids, and sorcerers banded together, lead by a demon cleric with a unique magic to capture essences inside of gems and purify them. This leader is Sogo. 

Being born out of races of the dawn affected by The Outsider, the demons are the easiest of the monsters for The Outsider to try to communicate with. 1000 years from the current time, a Demon Lord was born. However, they were kept a secret, even to the demons, and so the Demon Lord gained experience and power without any of the races of the dawn sensing the coming war. This Demon Lord is incredibly gifted with telepathic and Psionic powers, and is able to use these tools to gather and coalesce the demons into a singular force. The same powers allows him to quest across the world with his mind, looking for possible allies. When young and still experimenting with this power, he found an impossibly immense, and impossibly far away, mind: The Outsider. The Outsider promised power, glory, and the end of the races of the dawn if the Demon Lord could but release the seals on him. The Demon Lord agreed to the deal. However, the link between them was too fragile, too weak, for much help and information to be shared. The Demon Lord began looking into the history of The Fall, and found out about Sheem.

The Demon Lord made a deal with the Fey: have them plunder and kill everyone in the town where Sheem was. In return, the Fey will not be forced to choose a side in the war and will be treated by the demons as neutral third parties, individual Fey acting on their own with no side being chosen by the whole. The Fey agreed. As leverage, the Demon Lord used the fact that The Outsider had taught him the true-name of the current Summer Mother. The village hit was where Frieda Gallows was. The Fey that took her in was interested in taking her in and forming her into a warrior and vanguard in case the demons broke their promise. At least, the was the original plan. However, The Frozen One took her away, and their house was dishonored and stripped of power. Now Elorin travels alone, searching for Frieda and looking for his place in the coming war.


The Outsider hungers for destiny to consume. When his other part ascended, The Outsider was left without a destiny. Completely cut off from a purpose and a future, The Outsider forever hungers for the destiny of others. The Outsider has manipulated the Demon Lord so that the battle between the demons and the races of the dawn turns out quite different than destined. By having the battle end with the quick and total defeat of the demons (betraying them), the destiny of many on both sides will be cut off. Many, if not all, will fail to fully achieve their destined journey. Such shreds of unfulfilled destiny are food for The Outsider. 

In time, The Outsider hopes to consume such a volume of other's destiny that it itself will create a new destiny for itself from the myriad pieces consumed. However, it does not know what that destiny will entail.

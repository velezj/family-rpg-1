# Basics

The celestials are beings that travel across the universe, living an existence that is slightly out of reach of the mortal realms. However, they can communicate with and interact with the mortal plane (and hence the world). 

Seven celestials decided to stop their journeys on Cloven. This was before the races of Dawn, and hence before The Fall. Six celestials remain:

1. The Traveler
   - Giver of Curiosity and composition. The one who creates out of many.
2. The Frozen One
   - Giver of calmness and stillness. Giver of Peace.
3. Gamorr
   - Giver of doors and boundaries. Giver of growth
4. Dia
   - Giver of life and creations. Giver of Energy.
5. Orr
   - Giver of cycles and time. Giver of continuity and reason.
6. Erutrea
   - Giver of simplicity and Understanding
   
   
7. Jantrea (no longer around Clover)
   - Giver of Morality and Law

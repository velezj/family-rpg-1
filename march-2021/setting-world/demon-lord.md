Once in a great while, a [Demon](../setting-world/demons.md) is born that has the ability to unite the demons of the world under one rule. Such creates are called Demon Lords. Historically, a Demon Lord is able to cause catastrophic destruction of the world. The awakening of a Demon Lord is considered a calamity of such magnitude that all intelligent races unaffected by [The Fall](../setting-world/world.md) forget their differences and petty squabbles to band together and fight the demons. It has not always gone their way, and many millennia have been lost, their stories erased and untold, as the demons ruled the world.

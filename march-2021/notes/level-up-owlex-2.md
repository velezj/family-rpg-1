At second level the druid gains the following:
- Wild Shape (yay)
- choice of Druid Circle

# Homebrew Druid Spells

Rather than a druid being able to prepare any spell in the druid list, the Druids in the campaign must meet a nature spirit or guide to be taught spells. Each guide/spirit will have several spells to teach that make narrative sense (for the guide/spirit). 

For level 2, Owlex will meet with a nature spirit that will be able to teach the following:
- wild shape (narrative for the class skill )
- spell in the roll20 character
  - cantrips
	- primal savagery
  - level 1
	- beast bond
	- wolfsong
	- longstrider
	- nature's aegis

# Available circles:

## Circle of the Land
- Bonus Cantrip
  When you choose this circle at 2nd level, you learn one additional druid cantrip of your choice.
	
- Natural Recovery
  Starting at 2nd level, you can regain some of your magical energy by sitting in meditation and communing with nature. During a short rest, you choose expended spell slots to recover. The spell slots can have a combined level that is equal to or less than half your druid level (rounded up), and none of the slots can be 6th level or higher. You can’t use this feature again until you finish a long rest. For example, when you are a 4th-level druid, you can recover up to two levels worth of spell slots. You can recover either a 2nd-level slot or two 1st-level slots.

## Circle of Dreams

- Balm of the Summer Court
  
  At 2nd level, you become imbued with the blessings of the Summer Court. You are a font of energy that offers respite from injuries. You have a pool of fey energy represented by a number of d6s equal to your druid level.

  As a bonus action, you can choose one creature you can see within 120 feet of you and spend a number of those dice equal to half your druid level or less. Roll the spent dice and add them together. The target regains a number of hit points equal to the total. The target also gains 1 temporary hit point per die spent.

  You regain all expended dice when you finish a long rest.

## Circle of the Moon

- Combat Wild Shape
  
  When you choose this circle at 2nd level, you gain the ability to use Wild Shape on your turn as a bonus action, rather than as an action.
  
  Additionally, while you are transformed by Wild Shape, you can use a bonus action to expend one spell slot to regain 1d8 hit points per level of the spell slot expended.
Circle Forms

  The rites of your circle grant you the ability to transform into more dangerous animal forms. Starting at 2nd level, you can use your Wild Shape to transform into a beast with a challenge rating as high as 1 (you ignore the Max. CR column of the Beast Shapes table, but must abide by the other limitations there).

  Starting at 6th level, you can transform into a beast with a challenge rating as high as your druid level divided by 3, rounded down.

## Circle of the Shepherd

- Speech of the Woods

  At 2nd level, you gain the ability to converse with beasts and many fey.

  You learn to speak, read, and write Sylvan. In addition, beasts can understand your speech, and you gain the ability to decipher their noises and motions. Most beasts lack the intelligence to convey or understand sophisticated concepts, but a friendly beast could relay what it has seen or heard in the recent past. This ability doesn’t grant you friendship with beasts, though you can combine this ability with gifts to curry favor with them as you would with any nonplayer character.
	
- Spirit Totem

  Starting at 2nd level, you can call forth nature spirits to influence the world around you. As a bonus action, you can magically summon an incorporeal spirit to a point you can see within 60 feet of you. The spirit creates an aura in a 30-foot radius around that point. It counts as neither a creature nor an object, though it has the spectral appearance of the creature it represents.

  As a bonus action, you can move the spirit up to 60 feet to a point you can see.

  The spirit persists for 1 minute or until you’re incapacitated. Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a short or long rest.

  The effect of the spirit’s aura depends on the type of spirit you summon from the options below.

  **Bear Spirit**. The bear spirit grants you and your allies its might and endurance. Each creature of your choice in the aura when the spirit appears gains temporary hit points equal to 5 + your druid level. In addition, you and your allies gain advantage on Strength checks and Strength saving throws while in the aura.

  **Hawk Spirit**. The hawk spirit is a consummate hunter, aiding you and your allies with its keen sight. When a creature makes an attack roll against a target in the spirit’s aura, you can use your reaction to grant advantage to that attack roll. In addition, you and your allies have advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks while in the aura.

  **Unicorn Spirit**. The unicorn spirit lends its protection to those nearby. You and your allies gain advantage on all ability checks made to detect creatures in the spirit’s aura. In addition, if you cast a spell using a spell slot that restores hit points to any creature inside or outside the aura, each creature of your choice in the aura also regains hit points equal to your druid level.

## Circle of the Forged

- Circle Forms

  The rites of your circle grant you the ability to transform into more dangerous animal forms. Starting at 2nd level, you can use your Wild Shape to transform into a beast with a challenge rating as high as 1 (you ignore the Max. CR column of the Beast Shapes table, but must abide by the other limitations there).

  Starting at 6th level, you can transform into a beast with a challenge rating as high as your druid level divided by 3, rounded down.
Skin of Steel

- Starting at 2nd level, while you are transformed by Wild Shape, you gain the following benefits:

  - You gain a +2 bonus to Armor Class.

  - You have advantage on saving throws against being poisoned, and you have resistance to poison damage.

  - You don’t need to eat, drink, or breathe.

  - You are immune to disease.

  - You don’t need to sleep, and magic can’t put you to sleep.

  While in beast form, your body is made from the same materials as a warforged; your muscles are rootlike tendrils protected by armored plates. It’s obvious to an observer that you are not a normal animal.

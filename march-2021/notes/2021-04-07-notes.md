title: 2021-04-07 Session Notes
---

- found 8 beetle

- gathered 8 whitecaps

- Talked and friended quickling
  - Sam made a blood promise with it (pinprick to both fingers pressed together)
  - told them about goblins recently
	- got a bit of the "strangeness" of the Fey
  - only showed Joy and no emotion
  
- Gathered 15 Bloomswell

- walked an extra hour then camped (at slow slow mary speed)


- The blood promise was taken to be for the party. While sleeping, Gustavo, Owlex, and Mary will wake up to a small pinprick of blood scabbed over. There will be a smearing of white that stays on the skin not matter how hard you wash.

  - The promise will be taken to mean that *we will not hurt the tree* ... forever ... no time range was specified ... the Fey will take it to include secondary and even unintended consequences of *any* of the group ... so if an action or inaction somehow causes hurt down the line, even if unintended or unfathomable by human minds, the promise will be broken. As with all Fey, one of a family is the entire family, so descendants of each of the party will be held under the same promise.

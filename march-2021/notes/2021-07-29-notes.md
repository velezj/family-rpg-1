# session

- sam was ripped so only spirit came back

- garth explained his guess
  - some unknown to him magic he did not defend against took them but their bodies were protected by  barrier
  
- Garth gave same a rose necklace to use as a "body" of vessel for her spirit. It now adorns her spirit neck. She can use it to "hide in" making it a material necklace.

- Noticed Mary's symbol as The Frozen One

- Sam was "in the forest around Fir, within a day" sleeping so that is where her body is/was.

- Sam's other was left unconscious at the mist place

- Owlex investigated mist and found
  - it is magical
  - blocks or covers for senses: no sound, no taste, no feel, no smell, poor visibility.
  
- Gustavo burned part of the rope (in mist) so now Garth has a wound

	- disadvantage on ability checks

	- disadvantage on attacks and  saving throws
	- hit points maximum halved
  
# Notes

- encounter level for moth+swarm was off. XP was ~ 185 which should have put this at a easy level (or almost medium). But a party member nearly died and they were having a tough time of it. And this was with *many* lucking attack rolls from the party and normal luck for the monsters.
  - might need to recheck if the hardness was the monsters or just the party getting used to each other's fighting styles/techniques.

# What Happened

Y was captured by The Outsider and had their destiny eaten. The resulting shell was then infested with the dark power from The Outsider, turning them into a monster with the body and "mind" still there but now twisted.

While on a mission, the party was attacked by a group of monsters. During the attack, Y cut off X's head with their great-sword before anyone could react (the monsters were still being fought off). They then threw an axe at Bailor, striking her down her left collar bone, critically wounding her and stopping any healing. They then ran over to Z. At this point it was clear Y was attacking the party and so Z managed to deliver an arrow point-blank. However, Y grabbed Z as they lay dying and **bit** them. The bite was poisonous, putrid. Within a few seconds Z's body was wasting away. In less than 30 seconds Z was dead. Umrik and Garth finally snapped out of their stun. X and Z were dead, with Bailor pretty much also dead. Y was also dead, Z's shot being fatal. They grabbed Bailor and teleported out of there. Just as they disappeared into the magical vortex, both of them saw Z smile and look directly at them, clearly not dead (anymore?, ever?).

# Aftermath

The axe that embedded itself into Bailor was poisoned. Using their magic, Garth and Umrik managed to capture her spirit and mind as she died as well as stop the passage of time for her body. However, they are mages and not healers. They were frightened, panicked, and Bailor had so little time to live. Their spells and efforts were not, exactly, perfect. Eventually they were able to get her body physically healed. Her mind and spirit were not so lucky. While still Bailor, deep wounds and scar remain to this day on her mind and spirit. She is not fully sane. One of the reasons Garth and Bailor layed down roots near each other is for Garth to keep her in check and watch over her.

They looked for the bodies of X, Y, and Z. They never found them.

# Unknown to Garth

Y did not die, and took X and Z with them, transforming them.
X has been transformed into a Dullahan.
Z has become a soft-of "vampire". A Weaker version of what Y is. Z can make simple-minded "thralls" out of victims using their poisonous bite.

Bailor + Garth

- ask for party's help
- gustav says spirit ate the shadow being

Rosaline is completly , and inaturally, devoid of interest in this conversation

Show the book to Bailor
- "finally someone of culture"


For Next Time:
- bailor examines/talks  about book
  - the sister's have encountered "Erutrea's Projection" before. They have the legends of Jon-Yo at least
  - They have references to sentient books before, but nothing concrete
- bailor examines/questions the symbols and going to shadow place and bringing back a shadow on gustavo.
  - The sisters will know about shadow realm and will determine what the shadow really is.
	- it is a shadow parasite that slowly swells into the hosts shadow by eating their original shadow
	- once it has finished, the parasite will reproduce and larvae will attach themselves to other shdows.
	- the host then has no shadow
		- this confers immunity to radiant damage
		- vulnerability to psychic damage
		- disadvantage ob death saving throws
		- increased speed of 5ft (all movement types)
		- disadvantage on con saving throws
		- advantage on dex saving throws
		- shadows seem to reject target, disadvantage on stealth throes hen in dim or darker situations and using sight
		- short rest time doubled

# Story Changes

- The Frozen One actually gave Mary the gift of her spectral hand in order to help heer *control* her sygil magic.
- Mary gained sme sygil maric patterns (rune-warrior flavor)
- she will try to practice away from everyone, but her power is *wild* and uncrontrolled. It will cause accidents (even major ones such as minituarizing a few acres of land, etc)
  - the frozen one gave her the arm to control this power
- The arm/control needs something to be frozen encasing the arm, the easiest would be Mary touching water which will then freeze into the saphe of her arm for some time
- The Book knows, or suspects, this and will tell GUstavo that right now Mary isa danger and he *must* push her into some water as soon as possible for safety
- eventually as Mary grows in levels, she will be able to use other elements and materials and freeze them onto her arm to control her powers, but water is the first and easiest

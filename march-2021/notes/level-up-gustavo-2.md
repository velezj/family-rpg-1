## Spells and Learning

Unlike traditional wizards, Gustavo does *not* gain two spells "by default". All of his spell must come from a mentor, a scroll found, *or* taking the time to study a particular "theme" determined by Gustavo. This theme is used to compile a list of *possible* spells that his study stumbled upon. From this list, Gustavo can choose a single spell. A wizard can choose to study this way a number of time equal to half their intelligence modifier, rounded down, with a minimum of 1.

If a wizard spends at least a number of days equal to ( 2 * wizard level * spell level ) days with their master studying a theme or particular spell for a significant portion of their day, they can learn the spell at their next level up, or immediately, decided by the DM and the narrative.

For this first level, his study will only be able to produce 1 (int mod 2 / 2 rounded down, min 1) of those spells. However, Gustavo can now choose a theme of study for the next level up. Furthermore, when Gustavo meets and gets a master, the master will have a list of spells they will teach Gustavo.

For this first level, Gustavo also learn a bonus spell: find familiar. Further, he can cast the spell *once* without needed the components. The familiar will be **celestial** because of the connection Umrik gave to Gustavo during their spirit meeting.

## Arcane Tradition

Gustavo will have to meet a master and become and apprentice to them before he chooses the arcane tradition. Different masters may only be able to train him in a subset of the traditions. However, most master can handle low-level basics for any of the traditions as the fundamentals of magic are shared across all traditions. However, beginning at level 3, a master may not be able to teach a particular tradition because of lack of exposure to it or some other narrative device.

In this world, it is possible to have multiple "masters" as long as they each are fine with it. A master can be thought of as more of a teacher and guide rather than fully-controlling person.

# Arcane Traditions

## Abjuration

- Abjuration Savant

  Beginning when you select this school at 2nd level, the gold and time you must spend to copy an abjuration spell into your spellbook is halved.

- Arcane Ward

  Starting at 2nd level, you can weave magic around yourself for protection. When you cast an abjuration spell of 1st level or higher, you can simultaneously use a strand of the spell’s magic to create a magical ward on yourself that lasts until you finish a long rest. The ward has a hit point maximum equal to twice your wizard level + your Intelligence modifier. Whenever you take damage, the ward takes the damage instead. If this damage reduces the ward to 0 hit points, you take any remaining damage.

  While the ward has 0 hit points, it can’t absorb damage, but its magic remains. Whenever you cast an abjuration spell of 1st level or higher, the ward regains a number of hit points equal to twice the level of the spell.

  Once you create the ward, you can’t create it again until you finish a long rest.

## Conjuration

- Conjuration Savant

  Beginning when you select this school at 2nd level, the gold and time you must spend to copy a conjuration spell into your spellbook is halved.

- Minor Conjuration

  Starting at 2nd level when you select this school, you can use your action to conjure up an inanimate object in your hand or on the ground in an unoccupied space that you can see within 10 feet of you. This object can be no larger than 3 feet on a side and weigh no more than 10 pounds, and its form must be that of a nonmagical object that you have seen. The object is visibly magical, radiating dim light out to 5 feet.

  The object disappears after 1 hour, when you use this feature again, or if it takes or deals any damage.

## Divination

- Divination Savant

  Beginning when you select this school at 2nd level, the gold and time you must spend to copy a divination spell into your spellbook is halved.

- Portent

  Starting at 2nd level when you choose this school, glimpses of the future begin to press in on your awareness. When you finish a long rest, roll two d20s and record the numbers rolled. You can replace any attack roll, saving throw, or ability check made by you or a creature that you can see with one of these foretelling rolls. You must choose to do so before the roll, and you can replace a roll in this way only once per turn.

  Each foretelling roll can be used only once. When you finish a long rest, you lose any unused foretelling rolls.

## Enchantment

- Enchantment Savant

  Beginning when you select this school at 2nd level, the gold and time you must spend to copy an enchantment spell into your spellbook is halved.

- Hypnotic Gaze

  Starting at 2nd level when you choose this school, your soft words and enchanting gaze can magically enthrall another creature. As an action, choose one creature that you can see within 5 feet of you. If the target can see or hear you, it must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw against your wizard spell save DC or be charmed by you until the end of your next turn. The charmed creature’s speed drops to 0, and the creature is incapacitated and visibly dazed.

  On subsequent turns, you can use your action to maintain this effect, extending its duration until the end of your next turn. However, the effect ends if you move more than 5 feet away from the creature, if the creature can neither see nor hear you, or if the creature takes damage.

  Once the effect ends, or if the creature succeeds on its initial saving throw against this effect, you can’t use this feature on that creature again until you finish a long rest.

## Evocation

- Evocation Savant

  Beginning when you select this school at 2nd level, the gold and time you must spend to copy an evocation spell into your spellbook is halved.

- Sculpt Spells

  Beginning at 2nd level, you can create pockets of relative safety within the effects of your evocation spells. When you cast an evocation spell that affects other creatures that you can see, you can choose a number of them equal to 1 + the spell’s level. The chosen creatures automatically succeed on their saving throws against the spell, and they take no damage if they would normally take half damage on a successful save.

## Illusion

- Illusion Savant

  Beginning when you select this school at 2nd level, the gold and time you must spend to copy an illusion spell into your spellbook is halved.
  
- Improved Minor Illusion

  When you choose this school at 2nd level, you learn the minor illusion cantrip. If you already know this cantrip, you learn a different wizard cantrip of your choice. The cantrip doesn’t count against your number of cantrips known.

  When you cast minor illusion, you can create both a sound and an image with a single casting of the spell.

## Necromancy

- Necromancy Savant

  Beginning when you select this school at 2nd level, the gold and time you must spend to copy a necromancy spell into your spellbook is halved.

- Grim Harvest

  At 2nd level, you gain the ability to reap life energy from creatures you kill with your spells. Once per turn when you kill one or more creatures with a spell of 1st level or higher, you regain hit points equal to twice the spell’s level, or three times its level if the spell belongs to the School of Necromancy. You don’t gain this benefit for killing constructs or undead.

## Transmutation

- Transmutation Savant

  Beginning when you select this school at 2nd level, the gold and time you must spend to copy a transmutation spell into your spellbook is halved.

- Minor Alchemy

  Starting at 2nd level when you select this school, you can temporarily alter the physical properties of one nonmagical object, changing it from one substance into another. You perform a special alchemical procedure on one object composed entirely of wood, stone (but not a gemstone), iron, copper, or silver, transforming it into a different one of those materials. For each 10 minutes you spend performing the procedure, you can transform up to 1 cubic foot of material. After 1 hour, or until you lose your concentration (as if you were concentrating on a spell), the material reverts to its original substance.

## Order of Scribes

- Wizardly Quill

  2nd-level Order of Scribes feature

  As a bonus action, you can magically create a Tiny quill in your free hand. The magic quill has the following properties:

  - The quill doesn’t require ink. When you write with it, it produces ink in a color of your choice on the writing surface.
  - The time you must spend to copy a spell into your spellbook equals 2 minutes per spell level if you use the quill for the transcription.
  - You can erase anything you write with the quill if you wave the feather over the text as a bonus action, provided the text is within 5 feet of you.

  This quill disappears if you create another one or if you die.

- Awakened Spellbook

  2nd-level Order of Scribes feature

  Using specially prepared inks and ancient incantations passed down by your wizardly order, you have awakened an arcane sentience within your spellbook.

  While you are holding the book, it grants you the following benefits:

  - You can use the book as a spellcasting focus for your wizard spells.
  - When you cast a wizard spell with a spell slot, you can temporarily replace its damage type with a type that appears in another spell in your spellbook, which magically alters the spell’s formula for this casting only. The latter spell must be of the same level as the spell slot you expend.
  - When you cast a wizard spell as a ritual, you can use the spell’s normal casting time, rather than adding 10 minutes to it. Once you use this benefit, you can’t do so again until you finish a long rest.

  If necessary, you can replace the book over the course of a short rest by using your Wizardly Quill to write arcane sigils in a blank book or a magic spellbook to which you’re attuned. At the end of the rest, your spellbook’s consciousness is summoned into the new book, which the consciousness transforms into your spellbook, along with all its spells. If the previous book still existed somewhere, all the spells vanish from its pages.

## Bladesinging

- Training in War and Song

  2nd-level Bladesinging feature

  You gain proficiency with light armor, and you gain proficiency with one type of one-handed melee weapon of your choice.

  You also gain proficiency in the Performance skill if you don’t already have it.

- Bladesong

  2nd-level Bladesinging feature

  You can invoke an elven magic called the Bladesong, provided that you aren’t wearing medium or heavy armor or using a shield. It graces you with supernatural speed, agility, and focus.

  You can use a bonus action to start the Bladesong, which lasts for 1 minute. It ends early if you are incapacitated, if you don medium or heavy armor or a shield, or if you use two hands to make an attack with a weapon. You can also dismiss the Bladesong at any time (no action required).

  While your Bladesong is active, you gain the following benefits:

  - You gain a bonus to your AC equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of +1).
  - Your walking speed increases by 10 feet.
  - You have advantage on Dexterity (Acrobatics) checks.
  - You gain a bonus to any Constitution saving throw you make to maintain your concentration on a spell. The bonus equals your Intelligence modifier (minimum of +1).

  You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses of it when you finish a long rest.

## Illumination

- Illumination Magic Savant

  Beginning when you select this school at 2nd level, the gold and time needed to copy illumination spells into your spellbook is halved.

- Omen of Warning

  Starting at 2nd level, you can forecast danger for the next 24 hours by studying the stars for 1 hour. The stars must be visible to you for you to use this feature. Studying the stars in this way gives you advantage on up to two initiative rolls. The bonus remains for 24 hours or until the end of your next long rest.

  Instead of using this feature on yourself, you can grant advantage on an initiative roll to one other creature you can see when initiative rolls are made, but doing this prevents you from using the benefit on yourself in that combat. You can choose whether to use this feature at the moment initiative is rolled, but you must make the decision before rolling the die.

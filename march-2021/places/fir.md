# Summary

A small village catering to travelers across the forest, Fir provides a small amount of lodging, food and water, and not much else.

# Narrative Details

As soon as you get near Fir you notice that the forest path broadens into more of a hard, muddy patch. The buildings themselves are mostly embedded inside the forest trees, with the largest clearing being around the public well. The town itself is used to frequent travelers that are going or coming, so the people that live in town are courteous but distanced as they don't expect to see people again. 

The structures themselves are well cared for but not opulent. This is a town of frontier's people that cares for itself but understands that nature and the forest were there before the humans came and will be there after the humans are gone.

The main building and center of attention is the single tavern, [The Willow Stand](#the-willow-standard), which offers decent food at moderate prices and has several large rooms for travelers to rent. Across the tavern is [Maggor's](#maggors) which is a general store targeting travelers. On the south-east side of town you will find [Sack's Textiles](#sacks-textiles), a leather-worker/tailor, as well as [The Fern](#the-fern), an herbal shop.

Sack (owner and single worker) will be willing to trade for textiles. His workshop is the shop an so you will see him working on pieces of clothing. He is more than willing to take custom orders. He is a simple man and will sell things at base prices.

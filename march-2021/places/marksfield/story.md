# Backstory

The Marksfield town members will talk about a "new" member to their community: Danfir Rootbreaker. Four years ago (but still new since it's the last person to join the community and it has not been a decade yet :) ) Danfir moved into a far far out of town in the forest near the river. He came to research Necromancy. Specifically, he is interested in how the reborn are made and whether he can create such a construct that moves an entire soul from one body to another after death. This search has become his obsession. He wants to cheat death itself.

He has experimented on his animals and even his farmhands (unknown to them and without consent). He built a lab in a cave underground near the river. The released miasma into the river flowed into his lab and his farm, causing changes. It also caused a change in him. He changed from a Necromancer to a Necrophage, able to consume the very flesh to bolster his power.

He was not the best at keeping his experiments contained, and would actually pour strange potions into wells and water supplies or spray other's crop and see what happened. This caught the attention of Temo the Druid. Temo arrives as Marksfield and immediately senses that the strange liquid converging on the town is unnatural and of the un-dead. Temo begins to heal and filter the town. However, the root cause must be stopped in order for the healing to be finished.


# Hooks

- When the party arrives at Marksfield they make an unusual sight. Marksfield is a small community and gossip flows freely. Temo takes notice of the new arrivals and believes their timing is too coincidental to the liquid to ignore. He will investigate the party, thinking that they might have something to do with the strange events. Without subtlety, Temo will walk up to the party and accuse them of causing the liquid, asking them to prove they are not, in fact, responsible for the event. If he is persuaded, he will join in the search for the true source if the party decides to investigate it. The party cannot stop him from coming, even if he has to follow them :).

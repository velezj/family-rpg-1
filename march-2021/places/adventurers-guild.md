The Adventurer's Guild is a cross-country organization that organizes and handles request that may be dangerous or require great prowess involving the monsters of the world. In Kryta, the guild takes up the slack left by the [Crown's Guard](../setting-world/kryta.md), who is mainly worried about kingdom-level events and cannot be bothered to exterminate small pockets of monsters the show up in the countryside.

The guild actually extends across several countries and acts as a apolitical, neutral, unified system for requesting individuals and groups to help fight or protect against monsters.

# Narrative

Walking to the guild building you take in the scenery of [Beggarsbottom](../places/beggarsbottom/story.md). It's the largest town you have ever seen, and also the fullest. People are walking around on errands, some in a rush and other strolling about. You see all types of folk, halflings, gnomes, dwarves, elfs and even spot the back of what you guess -- and hope -- is a tortle (Kyle). You get to the area in front of the guild and notice a few people milling around. You see a toned person who seems to be carving something. They're sitting on the ground underneath the shade of the building. You also notice a short girl, wearing some sort of robes, whose eyes dart around quickly from one sight to another near the guild {[Violet Yamada](../characters/violet-yamada.md)}. 

perception check:
- on a DC 14 you see the girl's hands are shaking. 
- on a DC 15 you notice a humanoid kneeling on the roof of the build across from the guild. They seem to be dress in a multitude of colors and shades. Expecting it to look chaotic, you find that the designs and patterns actually fit quite well together and give the wearer an almost jovial presence. On and insight DC 10 you can tell they are looking at the girl in the robes {[Jenavive Willowmoon](../characters/jenavive-willowmoon.md)}. 
- in a DC 18 you notice that the humanoid on the roof is quickly taking small crumbled from inside her clothing and eating them. It reminds you of a bird and you see her pick up some small objects from the rooftop and store them inside her clothing. You think they were seeds.

You notice a short, skinny forest gnome standing against the shadows of a building. Her eyes seem to be taking in everything around her. In one hand she is holding a bread roll that looks untasted. When your eyes meet, you see her eyes widen, perhaps in recognition or surprise, and she flashes her teeth at you before continuing to scan the street. After a few more seconds you feel her eyes lock onto you in a steady, focused gaze. She slowly starts walking backwards, never leaving you from her sight, until she jump behind a corner and vanishes from your view. You notice the piece of bread she was holding on the floor where she had apparently dropped it. (On a DC 15, you see a bit of steam rising from the bread) {[Freida Gallows](../characters/frieda-gallows.md) notices the fey residue on you from the blood pact and runs}

As you arrive in front of the guild building, you notice that the doors are closed and the windows shuttered. You try to open the door but it is closed. After a few minutes of knocking ... ever more loudly ... you hear one of window squeak open. "What do you want!" The person that peers out the window looks bleary-eyed as if they just woke up. You can see that they are wearing some form of dark blue vest as well as a evil looking shine in their eyes. "The guild's closed you fools! Did you not read the sign ... even if you don't know how to read you should have seen the sign for closed .... then there's the locked door ... the shuttered windows ... and the complete and utter lack of liveliness in this building ... unless you think that I just like dark, dusty, stuffy rooms to bore myself to death!" The person sighs. "So ... now I'm up ... what do you want?" As you look around you do not see any sign posted to the door or the walls around. The person's eyes are slowly adjusting to the brightness outside and they are slowly softening their squint to a normal stare. They suddenly straighten up as they see [Mary](../characters/mary-tanner.md). "Rainbow Mary! You've come back! What are you doing here? Do you bring good news? Did you bring back the young ones? How's the war? Why are you here? Whose that beside you? Are they new, I haven't seen them around before? Have you been in town long? Did you take the road from Reed?" they ask question after question in rapid succession until they finally have to take a breath.

Mary: "Morning Gwen. I bring no news you don't already know. I've been traveling for the past three weeks so you know more than me about the war."

Gwen: "Three weeks! What have you being doing for three weeks! ... never mind ... how'd the young ones do?" [Mary](../characters/mary-tanner.md) stays quiet and you see Gwen plaster a large smile on their face. "Welcome to the Adventurers Guild. How can we help you today?" She's looking directly at everyone except [Mary](../characters/mary-tanner.md). "As you can see, we're closed. We are not accepting request or recruits at this time. All of our supplies have already been sold so I'm afraid we do not have anything to sell. I must also apologize that our staff has left and so we cannot provide any services or buy any materials you may have brought with you. As she says this you see that the smile never really changes in her face, and in fact her whole bearing and face seem pleasant and completely practiced. (insight DC 12 to know that the display is a complete facade and internally Gwen seems emotionally shock up and seems to be reverting to her training while she handles the scene in front of her). "You see, all adventurers have been called upon by Kryta to fight the risen [Demon Lord](../setting-world/demon-lord.md) this past month. I am here only because this is my house and I live here. I regret to inform you that, for the time being, the Adventurers Guild is closed." 

As Gwen finished her speech you see the person that was carving finish, stand up, and walk to the doors of the guild. They hang up what seems to be a sign, beautifully crafted in it's simplicity and design, the reads: "The Adventurers Guild is closed until further notice." The person gives a nod and you can her a relived sigh as the stretch. You realize that they must have been hunched over while working, for the tower above everyone else on the street and what you first thought were toned muscles were just a trick of the eyes as you see bulging muscles ripple underneath their clothes and around their sleeveless arms. They turn towards you and Gwen then bow, "Do not mind me, I was just fixing your sign. It was a sloppy job and you should have your sign-maker reprimanded."

At that you see Gwen's smile dip a little before it plasters back onto her face. "I will try harder next time. Thank you for your feedback." The crafter dives a small, awkward chuckle. "It would be an honor to train and apprentice. However, I am in the middle of a journey ... a vision quest you may say ... and would not presume, or impose, danger to my pupil." They give a small bow and start walking away from the guild, then stop suddenly and turns to look at your group. You see them make a quick, snapping motion with their right hand and a small breeze blows your hair around and then subsides. You see them turn and walk away, a smile no longer on their face.

(The crafter is [Riley Grayblood](../characters/riley-grayblood.md), and she noticed the scar on [Mary's](../characters/mary-tanner.md) neck as well as the adventurer necklace with her name on it around her neck.)

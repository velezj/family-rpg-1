The Adventurer's Guild is a cross-country organization that organizes and handles request that may be dangerous or require great prowess involving the monsters of the world. In Kryta, the guild takes up the slack left by the Crown's Guard, who is mainly worried about kingdom-level events and cannot be bothered to exterminate small pockets of monsters the show up in the countryside.

The guild actually extends across several countries and acts as a apolitical, neutral, unified system for requesting individuals and groups to help fight or protect against monsters.

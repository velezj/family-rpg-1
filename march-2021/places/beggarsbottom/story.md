The largest "town" around the southern tip of Kryta, Beggarsbottom is home to the closest [Adventurers Guild](../adventurers-guild.md). The guild is empty and closed since all the adventurers were called up to go fight the risen [Demon Lord](../../setting-world/demon-lord.md). Beggarsbottom is the home of the [Other Guild](../other-guild.md) and is the home of [Mary Tanner](../../characters/mary-tanner.md).

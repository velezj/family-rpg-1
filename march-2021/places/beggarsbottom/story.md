# Summary 

The largest "town" around the southern tip of Kryta, Beggarsbottom is home to the closest [Adventurers Guild](../../places/adventurers-guild.md). The guild is empty and closed since all the adventurers were called up to go fight the risen [Demon Lord](../../setting-world/demon-lord.md). Beggarsbottom is the home of the [Other Guild](../other-guild.md) and is the home of [Mary Tanner](../../characters/mary-tanner.md).

# Narrative Details

As you get close to Beggarsbottom it is the largest town you have seen. There are more structures in this town that you thought could be needed for anything. You also notice that there are quite a few people walking from place to place. Coming in from the south side of the town, you pass some buildings that look substantially more refined and detailed than you are used to. All the building you see are made of stone and brick with proper tiled roofs. It is definitely not like back home, or even like [Fir](../../places/fir.md). [Mary](../../characters/mary-tanner.md) points at a large building pressed right next to the path. "That's the tavern and inn. The food is actually pretty bad, but the rooms are clean if a bit expensive. They are 15 SP a night." She grimaces as she looks at the two of you. She thinks for a bit and gives a little nod "Yosh! How about you two stay with me. At least for a few days since this is the first time in this town and I know you don't have that much coin." She touches [Owlex's](../../characters/owlex.md) clothes. "Save those coins for supplies ..." Then she looks over at [Gustavo](../../characters/gustavo.md). "And equipment ... the right equipment may save your lives you know .... that is if you're going to try an be adventurers."


- Everyone will be talking about the rise of the [Demon Lord](../../setting-world/demon-lord.md) and the current status of the war.

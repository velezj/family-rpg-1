A small village in southern Kryta. The sewers are in need of their seasonal cleaning and the village hired a pair of adventurers to help. The pair never came back. The village sent for another group but found the [Adventurer's Guild](../places/adventurers-guild.md) closed. They then asked for the [Other Guild](../places/other-guild.md) to help.

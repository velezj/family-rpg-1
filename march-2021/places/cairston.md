The village itself is very small. Originally meant to be the headquarters of a mayor wizard and alchemist, the kingdom of Kryta built a special-purpose sewer treatment plant for the many processing and magical chemistry that was going to happen in the town. The plant was built, but the wizard never showed up. Now the village is juts a few families living on the bounties of the forest.

The sewers are in need of their seasonal cleaning and the village hired a pair of adventurers to help. The pair never came back. The village sent for another group but found the [Adventurer's Guild](../places/adventurers-guild.md) closed. They then asked for the [Other Guild](../places/other-guild.md) to help.

### Mack's

A transportation and courier business is run by Mack Harlly, his wife Madeline Harlly, and their three sons Evan, Steven, and Joseph.

Laid back, Mack and his crew always travel at their own, steady pace.

### Cecil's

The general store run by Cecil Hellman and her son Ivan Hellman. Most order are custom made. They make a trip down to [Beggarsbottom](../places/beggarsbottom/story.md) once every two week for 2 days and get whatever supplies people have asked for, as well as general sundries. 

Cecil herself used to be an adventurer with her partner Gwen. They had a son Ivan and decided to begin to settle down. As they looked for a place to bring up a family they took a job guarding a group of water mages and scholars going to build a new sewage plant in the middle of the forest. They fell in love with the pristine nature around Cairson and decided to stay. After the first year, Gwen felt a longing for the road and adventure again. Cecil stayed at home with baby Ivan while Gwen went on short jobs outside of town, staying away for no longer than four days. One day, she did not come back. It has been Cecil and Ivan ever since. Cecil still enjoys the beautiful scenery.

### Bart's Herbs

An empty, it has never been used, having been built by an order of the wizard's apprentice. No-one uses the building, but somehow every week the dust and grime disappears from the building, leaving behind and empty but spotless building. None of the villagers wants to work or live there, so it is left empty.

### Elder's House

A simple house where the village elder, Charlene Almony, takes residence. Charlene is usually working in the forest or helping out a villager and so is rarely found inside the house during the daylight hours. At night, she sits in front and is always seen reading a book. Most of the books are about natural history and the stories of the southern Kryta explorations. She is a quiet, harworking, and kind woman who always offers to help anyone, even strangers, and is quite reliable.

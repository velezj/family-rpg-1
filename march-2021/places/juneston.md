# Summary

A small village at the edge of the forest, Junston is regularly visited by farmers trading produce for goods of the forest.

# Narrative Details

Junston is on the main road between the forest and [Beggarsbottom](../places/beggarsbottom/story.md). It is a small farming village surrounded by the gentle hills of near the coast of southern Kryta. While there are some travelers that pass through, most decide to go into the forest through [Naver](../places/naver.md) so Junston has many more local residents and caters to the farming community.

To the right as you enter the town is the [Baron's Rest](#barons-rest), a local tavern, inn, and courier post. Across and to the left of the entrance is the [mayor's](#mayor) house: a relatively large building (for a village mayor) that also acts as a market during the day. At the very end of the road is [Sophie's Shed](#sophies-shed), a general goods store. Next to it on the right is [Gram's](#grams): a farming goods store specializing in feed and equipment for livestock. Lastly, next to the mayor's house if [The Timber Hut](#the-timeber-hut). It handles all wood and forest materials, from procurement, treatment and aging, to buying of rough or finished products.

# Notes

- The area near Juneston has recently been taken over by a nest of Harpys. Because of the lack of adventurers, the usual Harpy cleaning requests have not been filled and so  the nest has grown large enough that the Harpys have broadened their territory. They now claim a significant area around Junston and [Talewater](../places/talewater.md).

# Rumors

- There have been more harpy attacks lately between here and [Talewater](../places/talewater.md)

- There have been fewer travelers, although it's hard to tell. But there are always not enough traveler to spend their money.

- No-one has seen the Nate family in weeks which is uncommon for them. This means the tavern has been unusually quiet without the yelling of the eldest Nate.

- There are whispers of a [Demon Lord](../setting-world/demon-lord.md) but that is just to scare the kids.


# NPC and Building List

### Baron's Rest

Robert and Wife are all pleasant but aloof. Milly will be curios of travelers and asks for stories of adventures and details of where they have been and what they have heard.

Owned and operated by Robert Mills and his family. His eldest daughter Milly handles waiting tables and also is the accountant for the tavern. The wife Joanne handles the cooking with the help of their son Randall, who mostly scrubs pots.

A common tavern supplying all food and lodging for the town. Baron's Rest has a total of 8 rooms, 3 of which are unoccupied. Each room is 4 SP per, or 6 SP with 3 meals included. The food is pretty good and uses many of the fresh local ingredient grown around town. 

Few people are in during the middle of the day (from 8am - 3pm) since this is a farming community and those are prime working hours. More locals will start showing up around 4pm onward, and it will be pretty full by 7pm. The atmosphere it relaxed and friendly; visitors are just common enough that any new faces are treated with smiles rather than distrust. 


### Sophie's Shed

Anna is genial and welcoming and will try to be as helpful as she can be. Sophie seems to have a harsh look in her eyes and always expects everyone to cheat her.

The general store in Juneston run by Sophie herself. She and her daughter Anna own and operate the shop, with Sophie handling the books and Anna handling customer service. There are a few jobs that Sophie would be willing to pay the party to do.

### Gram's

Gram is a surly person with no time to waste on non-local farmers.

Gram runs a store of specialty farming equipment. He handles large custom-made of made-to-order equipment such as tills, hoes, oxen cart and all such equipment. There is not a blacksmith of metalsmith in the village so Gram supplies most metal tools to the community. Once a month Gram closes his store for 3 days to travel and gather supplies from [Beggarsdbottom](../places/beggarsbottom/story.md) to bring to the village and sell as well as place custom orders.

### The Timber Hut

Run by the loud, muscled, and good-hearted Evan, The Timber Hut handles all things wood and forest related. The hut will have a sign board outside with available errands to run and their pay. The main worker is Evan and you can see that several youths of the surrounding farms are helping him out.

### Mayor

The mayor is currently out of town, having gone with a group to check out reports of Hapys.

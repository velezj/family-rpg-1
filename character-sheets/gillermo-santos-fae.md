### IDENTITY

```
Name        : Gillermo Santos
Description : No-one knows where Gillermo was born. By the time he was
              12 he was already known as "El Grillo" because of his
              small size but fierce tenacity; he jsut kept coming
              back. He joined the Cartel Del Golfo as a runner. Soon
              he was leading his own group. When he was 23, Gillermo
              disappeared. For 3 years no-one heard of him. He then
              appeared back in the northern Yucatan peninsula
              and started his own cartel, quickly gaining territory
              and people from the Zetas cartell. He is not the major
              boss in the norther yucatan peninsula. However, Gillarmo
              has stopped trying to expand his territory and has since
              entrnched his control over the region. While he has his
              hands into all drug and smuggling of illegal goods, he
              is also the major importer of health and food for the
              region. Gillermo is known to actaully, physically, talk
              to the people around the yucatan and can sometimes be
              seen delivering medical supplies to smaller towns.
              While Gillermo is a man of few words, he is known
              as a person that does not lie and people will trust
              what he says.
              
              
              GM NOTES:
              
              During the missing 3 years, Gillermo started and became
              a leader in the Cult of Zerta, which among other deities
              tries to help and support the Elder Gods, including
              Vorvados. He came back to the Yucatan because of a 
              vision he had of Vorvadoss returning to the north.
              He has not started his own cult, but has some agents
              with him and also can call on the other leaders if 
              needed. Gillermo has an affinity for the Innsmouth
              recursion and will immediatly feel the arrival of
              Vorvadross (Alejandro) but will have trouble pinpointing
              the exact location. Then again, a sudden crash right
              after the feeling is pretty coincidental.

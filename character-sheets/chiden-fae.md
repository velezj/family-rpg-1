### IDENTITY

```
Name        : Chiden 
Description : Sub-Commander of the Ruk Intelligence Cadre. Chiden was
	          born in the core of Ruk proper to afluent parents. Since
			  birth he has demostrated an uncanny ability to deceive
			  and deflect both mentally and phisically. During his
			  growth years Chiden would often sneak around impersonating
			  officials and successfully started a small beurocratic
			  war between the Interstellar Commitee and the Priests of
			  The Song. As punishment, the priests took him in for
			  the remainder of his academic years.
			  
			  Combinig the core Ruk know-how and high society with
			  the determination and focus gained from the priesthood,
			  Chiden began a long career in the Intelligence community.
			  He has helped shape the goals and strategies employed
			  by hte Ruk to gather and dissiminate information about
			  the Eart Universe and Earth itself.
			  
			  A strong believer in The Song and an ardent follower of
			  the priests, his goal is to bring forth Ruk into the
			  Earth universe and re-gain the lost Song for his fellow
			  Ruk. Behaving in an almost fanatical way, Chiden will
			  consider every possibility and scenario and will never
			  turn something away because it is "impossible". This
			  viewpoint has made him incredibly adept at gathering
			  together an intelligence community under him that
			  is quickly becomming a pinacle of Ruk superiority.
			  
			  Knowing his own weaknesses: his mostly average logic and
			  his weak physical presence, Chiden has trained or 
			  gathered officers that complement each other and himself.
			  Chiden is the one who accepted and fully utilized Ganut
			  as well as staying his hand over the renegade Imi and
			  his wild (but potentially fundamental) ideas. Very 
			  little goes on in Ruk that he does not know about.
			  
			  He views The Estate and the Division of Magic as his
			  most vehement enemies and the barriers towards the Ruk
			  regaining The Song.

### IDENTITY

```
Name        : Mark Chan
Description : Mark Chan was born under SATI control. Both his parents
              a SATI science officers. However, Mark was always 
              adventurous and rebellious. He would often wonder
              off and survive alone. He met Vin when he was just 8
              years old (a very young age). Mark kept Vin secret from
              his parents (SATI was not the most humane towards
              other animals). Mark truned away from the high-tech
              SATI culture and started going off with Vin on
              week-long adventures. Of course, his parent being SATI
              scientists meant that he was taught all about tech,
              but he learned most of his knowledge out in the
              world wandering with Vin. 
              
              It was during one of these trips that he met the Tribe.
              Unlike SATI, the Tribe took animals as companions; true
              friends and equal allies against to larger world.
              He soon started learning the purpose of the Tribe, and
              the true purpose of SATI (he was uninformed until then).
              He was eager to join the Tribe. However, the Tribe
              had some reservations because, while Mark and Vin
              together could survive almost anywhere, neither were
              very good at taking their time and being careful.
              In fact, Mark and Vin never really planned anything and
              went with instinct.
              
              At age 16, the Tribe finally gave Mark a simple operation
              to follow and learn the goals of a janitor at SATI.
              The Tribe wanted to use this simple assignment to 
              teach Mark what it's expectations were in terms of
              fully finishing a mission. 
              
              It turns out that the "simple janitor" was actually 
              a Renegade Ruk (Imi). Mark tailed him and crossed over
              the portal to Earth without really having a way out
              or a plan. When he crossed over, he was hurt because this
              was his first crossing and he just barely made it before
              the portal fully closed. For that first week, Mark
              recovered mostly with the Help of Vin who hunted
              for both of them and kept predators away.
              
              Now in a new world, Mark is still chasing after the Ruk.
              Both because it may be his only way back, but also
              to fulfill his mission of finding the goal of the Ruk.

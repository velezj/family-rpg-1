### IDENTITY

```
Name        : Gerald Walt
Description : Geralt Walt was born in the core worlds of the federation, away
	          from frontiers or wars. There, he grew until his 12th birthday
			  when he was enrolled at Morthial, the prestigious school for 
			  mages in the middling region (the core having few dealings
			  with magic). It was there that Gerald became interested in the Og.
			  In particular, he became engrossed with their idea of
			  deities as simply other-beigns. At 17 he was awarded the chance
			  to visit an Og magic school for a year of study. It changed his
			  view of the Federation forever. 
			  
			  After finishing his primary years at Morthial he was given
			  the mark of the mage and asked to join the Federation
			  Council. Gerald refused and went traveling for 5 years.
			  He visited the Og, the outer planets and frontier of the
			  Federation, as well as some of the nearby Kree systems. While
			  the Kree are wary of the Federation, they are also highly 
			  interested in magic and teachers of it.
			  
			  At age 25 he was caught up in a battle between the Kree and
			  the Federation for a rural system where he was a teacher. The
			  destruction he witnessed, by both the Kree and the Federation,
			  shook his belief in goverment. He passed as a refugee into a
			  system of the Og and took stock of his life and his future.
			  The Og, he believed, had a higher sense of morality and were
			  in tune with his own ideals. However, as he lived within the Og
			  system he came to realize that, individually, no one person can
			  change an entire culture. The Og are what they are because they
			  are together and their morality stems from their goverment
			  and institutions. They truly lead by example.
			  
			  After 10 years living off the land in Og space, Gerald returned
			  to the Federation and sked to serve the Federation Council
			  as part of the Division of Magic. Gerald's travels had given him
			  a unique, and quite practical, magical enducation. He knew not
			  only that taught by the Federation, but also the Og and the Kree.
			  While his raw magical power was mediocre, his ability and skill
			  using magic, and his immense real-life experience, made him one
			  of the Federation's greatest mages. 
			  
			  Within the Division of Magic, he spearheded efforts to open
			  acedemic channels between Og, Kree, and Federation. He was
			  a smooth negotiator, relying on compassion and imagination
			  rather than strong-arm tactics. He took the Federation's
			  study-abroad program, previously available in only in a small
			  number of magic schools, into a nation-wide network of magic
			  academics connected through the universe and representing
			  Kree, Og, Dal, and Federation nations. 
			  
			  Gerald was also known as a prominent voice for practical magic
			  schooling and began the now-exemplary "Magic Technicals" program
			  where less powerful and more practical students are taught
			  the real-world craft and techniques. This greatly influenced and
			  sped up the Federation's reliance on Time-Magic travel, since
			  the technical program is now producing many practical mages
			  that end up working for the goverment.
			  
			  Gerald took up the seat of Head of the Division of Magic with no
			  votes against and no running opponent. When the phenomena
			  of disappearing planets began, he was tasked by the Federation
			  to investigate after it became clear that it was not only 
			  happening in Federation space, but also Og and Kree as well.
			  
			  Believing that creativity and imagination are essential to
			  problem solving and investigation, especially of the unknown,
			  Gerald contacted a previous student and brilliant mage Olivia.
			  He was shortly killed, along with the majority of the Division
			  of Magic, when their headquarter's planet was partially
			  destroyed by a massive, unknown, collision.

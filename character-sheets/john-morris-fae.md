### IDENTITY

```
Name        : John Morris
Description : Dedicated Marine capable of flexibly adapting to demanding
	          missions, John Morris is a true asset to the Navy.
			  Except for his inability to connect to people. Every
			  single commander has asked for him to reassigned 
			  after several successfull missions. He jsut cannot
			  stay quiet and must always speak his mind, even
			  to his higher-ups. His attitude has
			  finally landed him babysitting a science survey in
			  the Gulf of Mexico. He's treating it like a boring
			  vacation.

### STUNTS

_I Meant to Do That_
Once per long rest, can add +2 to any roll without spending a fate point, even on top of a fate-spending +2 (total of +4 then)

_Come Here!_
+2 on any attack roll against a close opponent with fists or a short weapon (hand-sized such as knife, magazine, etc.)

_Just Where I Need You_
One per long rest, can make a close opponent that was attacked by him with a short weapon pose in any single pose (faint, dizzy, choking, etc). This does not change the result of the roll and does not need a successful attack.

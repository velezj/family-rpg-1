### IDENTITY

```
Name        : Drof
Description : From his first recolections, Drof has been interested in
	          all forms of life. Applying the zeal that most Ruk have
			  for science and logic, Drof systematically analyzes
			  the living world around him. During the middle of his
			  academic years, Drof began to quetion the taxonomy
			  used by Ruk for living things. He was certain that
			  the small and rigid organization system, similar to
			  Earth's, was obselte and hindering the progress of 
			  learning even new facets about life itself.
			  
			  The Ruk, as a whole, have little variation and Drof
			  quickly got bord by conventional biology. His
			  search for life and his curiosity led him to the
			  field of Xenobiology, in which he became a respected
			  leading figure for 10 years. However, his quest for life
			  and knowledge, aong with his unyielding edith of 
			  "No Assumptions", led his down paths of knowledge that
			  the field, and the Ruk in general, found essoteric and
			  altogether a wate of time and energy.
			  
			  For the passt 10 years, Drof has become obseccess with
			  the scale and observation of living beings. How small
			  can life be? How large? Can all life be observed by
			  the living, or is there life perceptible onyl to
			  machines? What, excatly, is the structure that binds
			  chaos into what we call a "living beign"? 
			  
			  He has recently been contacted by Ganut, and itelligence
			  officer, with a tantelizing problem: Dissapearing planets.
			  Drof has started to create a theory about living beings
			  so large and different from ourselve that time itself
			  is part of their structure. Drof has started looking
			  into planetvores. During his studies he has also come
			  to believe that the very history of Ruk itself is
			  linked to such beings, for Drof truly believes that
			  Ruk and the Song are actually names for once such
			  being that they inhabit which is outside of Earth's
			  universe in a place altoghether different yet similar.

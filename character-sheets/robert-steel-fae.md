### IDENTITY

```
Name        : Roberta Steel
Description : Born in a small town in Iowa to conservative parents,
              Roberta decided to get out of town as soon as she 
              could. She was given a schoralship to a local military
              highschool and quickly excelled at leadership and
              tactics. She joined the Navy and finished her Master's
              degree in Aerospace Engineering at Virginia Tech.
              
              He navy career has been excellent. She worked her way 
              up the ranks showing intelligence, cunning, and
              a sure leadership trait for making quick, accurate,
              and touch decisions. 
              
              At 35 she became vice-adminal for the Gulf fleet.
              After ten years, the Admiral retired and she became
              the Admiral for the Gluf fleet. Since she has overseen
              the inclusion of more civilian projects as well
              as the murky politics of arms and oil. However, her
              deft hands and quick mind have allowed the Gulf fleet
              to perform admirably and decisively during her watch.

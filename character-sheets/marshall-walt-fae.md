### IDENTITY

```
Name        : Marshall Walt
Description : Marshall was born into a magic crisis: his grandfather 
	          and leader of the Division of Magic was dead. So were
			  most of the members. It was foul play by one of the
			  most exemplary creative time witches. She has disappeared.
			  The Walt legacy is in ruins after years of depression
			  and the militarization of magic away from the 
			  citizen Division of Magic and towards  the
			  Division of Defence.
			  
			  Into this vortex Marshall was born. He quickly became
			  interesting in the Walt name, and in his grandfather
			  Geralt Walt. Gerald was once hailed as the createst of
			  mages, apt in both magic and policy. He was a bridge
			  between the Og and the Federation, alowwing and
			  sustaining academic ties through the universe.
			  
			  Marshall grew up trying to immitate his hero: Gerald.
			  He studies magic, and although not as string as his
			  grandfather's gift, Marshall was still a top-rated
			  mage by the end of his education. Following his legacy,
			  Marshall joined the Division of Magic. There, he
			  was suddenly thrust into the realities of the 
			  Federation politics. The Division after Gerald was in 
			  tatters, and in the interveining years was left
			  to essentially whither into a group of shell-shocked
			  mage still living in the 'good'ol days'.
			  
			  Marshall became the head of the Division, mostly because
			  he cared and no-one else did. He has spend the years
			  since trying to cultivate and grow a Division of
			  Magic that would make Gerald proud. But politics have
			  inertia, and gathering talents has become increasingly 
			  hard. It is especially true since the rummors of
			  dissidence and civil unrest in Og. Young, eager mages
			  want to defend the Federation, not study the deep
			  magics and chart the civilian paths towards knowledge.

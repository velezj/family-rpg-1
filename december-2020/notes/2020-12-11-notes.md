### In the background

Sarah Lark has learned of a potential place for the Gudgeon. More importantly, she was learned from Chiko Yasu that the Gudgeon may very well be carrying the lost Japanese from from WW2. Together, they work out a plan. Chiko sends Ai Fujita with Sarah's team to keep an eye out for things (in case Sarah isn't as trustworthy as she seems). Ai's goal is to protect the party and report to Chiko.

Unbeknowst to them, Blaire Watts has learned of Sarah's plans (but does not know about Chiko). She feels the Gudgeon should be a historical treasure, not some grave to be robbes. As such, she commands Miguel (one of a few of Sarah's people still loyal to Blaire) to help ensure the wreck is handled properly (i.ie not stolen). She furtehr contacts Mr. Combs, who heads the Japan Cultural Procurement Office (they are in charge of historical heritage works, but surprisingly Mr. Combs seems like a capable fighter as well).

Even if the gold is found, Sarah and Chiko must somehow transport it. They make a deal with a smuggling operation lead by David Tosie. In return for some of the gold, they will transport the rest out of Micronesia nad japan waters. Of course, if David thinks he can somehow keep all the trasure ... well, he is a smuggler.

Antonia, leading the operation, finds and uses Naomi's services to get equipment for the party. She also hires a well known corrupt beaurocrat, Flathin Palemar, to smooth out any issues with the Micronesia goverment.

However, Falthin look into what Antonia is planning and starts fishing for information. David Tosie sends his pesuasive speaker Howard Rendalt to try to make a deal with Falthin: Together they take all the gold, and Falthin helps David smuggle it out and bride those needed in the goverment. Having learned about the gold, Falthin contacts his friend Jimmy and telss him of the treasure. 

Now, Falthin and Jimmy want all the treasure to themselves and figure they don't need smugglers. The msugglers also want the gold, although they are willing to part with a small amount of it to Falthin for help. 

Meanwhile, the JSDF, contacted by Mr. Combs, has begun to troll the seas in search of ways that the gold could be trasorted (so looking for smugglers). They are also told about the party and the operation, and told to help *winding* the treasure but then help make sure the treasure is not taken by enyone except the goverment of Japan.

Get the party together and setup the shipwreck hunt in Micronesia.

# Setting

Each PC will be asked, individually, to meet with the reclusive "Sarah Lark". They will be very persuasive. The NPC will then take the PC to a helicopter and fly them to Sarah Lark's Lodge in Italy.

Once all PC are gathered in the lodge, Sarah herself will introduce the job: Finding her great grandfather's remains for a proper burial. She will explain about the Gudgeon and it's history. She will also tell the party about her discovery of a new potential location for the reasting place of teh Gudgeon.

Sarah's family and ancestor were Shinto practitioners and believe that her great grandfather has reached a state of being a ill-mannered spirit. Therefore the family needs the body to perform the purification rites to turn the spirit in a peaceful kami.

If asked, Sarah employed several historians to learn of this location. Using her connections and money the historians were able to look at and go places no other historian was really able to before, hence the new information.

Sarah promises it will be worth the party's effort and will employ the following tactics:

- Appealing to the pure nature of request (burial) using religion (Shinto)
- Money
- Connections
- Future stable employment
- Threat of becomming unemployable, untouchable because of Sarah
- kidnapping PC

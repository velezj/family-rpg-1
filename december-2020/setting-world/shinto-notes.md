# Basics

- Shinto "spirits" are called Kami.

- nearly everything has a spirit
  - natural things (a tree, fire)
  - ancestors/people
  - places
  - animals
  - abstract ideas (rebirth, harmony)

- There are "good" and "not good" spirits from the point of view of violence towards humans and eternal peace (not in absolute terms)

- Yokai are non-peaceful spirits that were unable to be purified by a shinto ritual

- rituals often involve
  - water
  - salt

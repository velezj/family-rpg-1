Overall Crime and Safety Situation

The U.S. Department of State has assessed Kolonia as being a LOW-threat location for crime directed at or affecting official U.S. government interests. Many Micronesians do not formally report crimes such as rape or domestic violence due to cultural stigmas.  Non-confrontational property crimes (home break-ins) are the type of crimes most likely to affect those residing in or traveling to Micronesia. In July 2019, several U.S. Navy Seabees were in a car when a man drove up near them and fired a rifle into the air. In addition, a U.S. Embassy spouse reported sexual harassment from a taxi driver and passersby.

Handguns are illegal throughout the Federated States of Micronesia, but local residents may wield guns as a form of intimidation outside of city limits.  Rifles are legal in Ponhpei and Kosrae with hunting permits.

In October 2019, someone shot and killed a U.S. citizen serving as the acting Attorney General with a shotgun in Yap.  

Traveling on foot after dark in Micronesia can be dangerous due to the lack of sidewalks, no streetlights, stray dogs, frequent torrential downpours, and drunk drivers.

Crime rates are significantly higher in Chuuk than in the other three states. Incidents in Chuuk have recently included assaults on U.S. citizens. Crime increases at night and alcohol usually plays a role, especially in assaults. Maintain situational awareness and avoid individuals who appear to be intoxicated. Do not attempt to intervene in disputes between local citizens.

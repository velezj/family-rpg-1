# Summary

## Alajandro

Being pulled through space-time by black liquid on ankle. Was seen by Olivia but not recognized (they have never met)

## Dr Volken

Fled agents (two types). Lab was destroyed in reging fire. Examined blakc liquid vial and knows it is nothing like any human has ever seen before. Fled to silo in the Gulf of Mexico. Second agents (The Estate) left something outside entrance to silo but he did not exit to check. As they left, agents told him to "Seek the Frozen People." The Federal Agents had a note from colleague Dr. Wilson saying Dr. Wolken was the right person to consult for the black liquid.

## Olivia

Felt and saw ripple a Alejandro flew by. Attached bubble around him but the bubble started moving with Alejandro. Was contacted by the Federation Council and decided to feingh communications error. Was later contacted by the Magic Division and asked to help solve the dissappearing planets problem. Theory from division is that time magic is involved and Olivia has the most practical experience with time magic. Magic Division used a projection to communicate but as cutoff near the end (unknown why).  Currently augmented (duck-tape-like) startship to follow Alejandro throush space-time.

## Senior Owl

Met Spirit Mouse and his stuck tail. Stopped the bead on mouse's tail from moving using his knowledge and time magic. Frozen humans started comming towards mouse. Senior Owl got close enough to see the black liquid on the frozen men. Was pulled from the spirit real into the physical world by the black liquid in the Frozen men. The pull was stopped when The Estate agent (unkown to him as The Estate) passed by with the vial contained the sample black liquid. This caused Senior Owl to now be somewhere betwen the spirit and physical world. He is still a spirit but can interact almost fully with the physical world and can be seen by most humans (except those completly devoid of spirit, such as a Ruk).

# Events that are happening

- Division of Magic has begun theory about planet disappearance and time magic. They had *not* detected Alejandro but Olivia did and told her to go with it.
- The Estate agents dropped of the black liquid with Dr. Volken and told him to "Seek the Frozen People."

# Characters

## Female and Male Federal Agents

Unnamed. They left the black liquid to Dr. Volken along with the note from Dr. Wilson. Dr. Volken did *not* invite them in and they did not have a long conversation. They have been "mistrusted" before. Themale agent bows to the female agent. These agents work for the US goverment and are in charge of the "Frozen Men" incident in Yucatan Mexico. They are going to come back to Dr. Volkner's lab tomorrow.

## Dr. Wilson

Colleague of Dr. Wolkner. Told federal agents about his genius and nominated him for the job of consulting regarding the blak liquid. Terse. Is probably working with the federal agents on the "Frozen Men".

## Female and Male Estate Agents

Unnamed. They tried, *very hard* to talk to Dr. Volkner. Spooked him into running away. Were almost caught in the lab accident (explosion). They have several cyphers and powers that allow them to project and hear thought materials as well as bursts of speed (almost burst teleporataion). Male agent slightly burned in explosion. Male agent deferes to Female agent. After lab incident, followed Dr. Volkner *discretely* so that he would not spook more. At the lab, took blakc vial sample *before explosion* because they know about "Frozen Men" and know black liquid is something important. They are the agents in charge of a pssible Ruk incursion/sighting and strange event near Malina Mexico in the Yucatan. Were only trying to get Dr. Volkner to help but are somewhat new to the job and are very headstrong (hence they kept trying to talk to him). Femal agent in partocular took his running as the challenge. She is a cat-person from another incursion that is now working for The Estate, hence running invariably triggers a chase response.

## Spirit Rat

Complement spirit to Ghost Owl: knowledge (owl) versus cleverness (rat). Asked owl for help when tail got stuck. Was sent to investigate the "Frozen Men" appearance in the spirit world in physical form by the Spirit Guardians and was touched by the black liquid. Was trying to run away when tail got stuck. Does not realize he has become somewhat more physical because of the liquid (though less than owl). Is one of the best spirits for understanding, using, and modifying science and magic; he's basically and uber hacker of science and magic ... and of really any system in this universe. Will sense the Ruk renegade and his technology now that he is more physical.

# Overview of Universe

Seven years ago, planets started disappearing. Not in the blink of an eye, but ruptured from the inside, violently torn asunder. People from the planets likewise disapeared, although less violently, but just as suddenly. None have survived, as far as the universe knowns. That is about to change.

# Hook for Alejandro

His planet disappears. As he is going about his daily life, a great rift tears through right next to him. He feels a wet liquid lap at his ankle then he tumbles into the rift. Searing pain then emptyness. A garbage barge picks him up, flaitng in debris where his planet once stood. He is the only survivor. His only clue: his ankle seems to have been spliced with the liquid, making his left ankle apear to shimmer and be made out of a viscous, black substance.

The black liquid longs to reunite with young planetvore on earth and will start pulling him over spacetime to the past. He lands in yucatan at the time of Gustavo's character. This is "the past" for him and so his planet, and people, are still alive.

# Hook for Gustavo

Federal agents consult with him about a mysterious "black liquid" found in the yucatan. They has a miniscule sample. He realizes that this liquid has no understanding in the human world. The agents will not tell him anything more. A little later Estate agents, posing as federal agents, approach him to consult on the "freeze". He realizes they might be related and the Estate agents ask him to come and help them.

# Hook for Daphne

One of her time spell goes wrong and she feels a large ripple over time magic. Since she is the best, few if any others feel it. Shortly thereafter, she witnesses Alejandro being dragged to earth through space-time like a skipping stone over water. She has never seen this before.  If she does not get the bait, the Federation Council will ask her for a consult on the black liquid, in the yucatan.

# Hook for Abuelo

As Abuelo is flying in the spirit world he discovers the "frozen" humans. They are also frozen in the spirit world, where they should not even be. Furthermore, near them his powers start to alter and he starts to become stronger in the physical world, almost like he was before becoming a spirit. He recognizes Daphne as a powerful magic vortex. He also feels fear of the Ruk incursion and Renegade Ruk.

# The Black Liquid

The black liquid wants to cluster and be returned to the young planetvore. It will pull any who are around it, study it, or are touched by it.

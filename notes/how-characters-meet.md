# Overview of Universe

Seventeen years ago, planets started disappearing. Not in the blink of an eye, but ruptured from the inside, violently torn asunder. People from the planets likewise disapeared, although less violently, but just as suddenly. None have survived, as far as the universe knowns. That is about to change.

# Hook for Alejandro

His planet disappears. As he is going about his daily life, a great rift tears through right next to him. He feels a wet liquid lap at his ankle then he tumbles into the rift. Searing pain then emptyness. A garbage barge picks him up, flaitng in debris where his planet once stood. He is the only survivor. His only clue: his ankle seems to have been spliced with the liquid, making his left ankle apear to shimmer and be made out of a viscous, black substance.

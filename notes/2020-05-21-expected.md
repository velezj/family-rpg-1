# Scenes


**scene 1**
Ghost owl, who is awake but paralized, sees the following play out.

_description:_ 
Abi and Melhorn sky-ski through the marshes and then up towards Merida.
They do not take any roads and stay clear of most settlements in between.
In fact, they will automatically move where they are best conceiled.
Melhorn will take vitals and make sure everyone is still alive.

_Melhorn_: They're all still alive. But it's nothing I've seen before. Not magic eatiehr or we would feel it.

_Abi_: _grunt_( hmmm )

_Melhorn_: Maybe next time we could try talking first before we blow people up

_Abi_: _lokking over at Melhorn_ you know they shot at us first right? 

_Melhorn_: yes ... but maybe next time you could just take off a limb or two instead of blasting them to pieces...

_Abi_: _looking back to her driving_ That wasn't me. I hit the engine block but nothing on a boat should have caused it to explode ... _grunt_ and you know I don't like being cruel. Clean shot I take it, or no shot at all.

_Melhorn_: welll .... we got this ... thing out of it .... _looking at scrapped mass_ .... it had to have been inside those crates .... _looking into the jar_ just what are you and what were they doing with you? ...

_description_

abi and melhorn get to estate after weaving through Merida into the east corner of hte city. No-one pays any attention to them and it looks like no-one even
sees them.

_reaching estate building_

_Abi_: Got an ugly comming in!

_she grabs alejandro and puts him on her back. She also reaches for ghost owl and holds him by his feet, and starts carrying them into the building.

_Abi_: jeeze ... feel like this guy's gotten heavier...

_When she enters the building, most of the poeple immediatly let out a scream seeing alejandro. Some fall out of their chairs and a couple actaully throw up. However, their training kicks in and no-one draws any weapons and they all quite down (although most still shake). The office is set up so that everyone can see everything. Even the walls for inner rooms are clear and see-trough._

_Abi carries them into a room and places them in beds, a medical/examination room of some sort but with some equipment ghost owl does not recognize. Melhorn also comes into the room carrying Olivia, setting her in the last of the beds._

_Abi_: will you look at that ... who would've thought Benton could keep his cool under pressure ... _gesturing with her head to and agent who had not even flinched when Alejandro was brought in_

_Melhorn_: _grunts_

_Abi sets down on a chair at the enf of the room and leans back, putter her boots up onto Olivia's bed and streching her hands behind her head._

_Melhorn_: _shaking his head_ I guess **I** will go and fetch Jean ...

_Abi_: sounds good _she says while touching her right knukle to her nose then closes her eyes as Melhorn leaves in search of Marla_

_After a minute you see Abi pick herself up and also leave the room. Except that something feels strange to you about her look. If you really focus she looks to be a little fuzzy and the light doesn't quite look normal around her._

# Background and Bio

Born in Ardwyn to farmer parents, her magic powers quickly separated her from the rest of the village. She left her village at age 10 before a royal mage could come and test her. She became a traveler and survivor, eventually meeting Grimson a ranger. Grimson took her in and taught her tracking, hunting, and skill with bow and blade. By age 15 she was a full-fledged ranger and became a scout in the norther territories.


2 years later the Shapeshifter Wars started. She was assigned to a company which was to take mages from the north back to the royal city in order for them to help in the war. No one expected a norther attack, and no one saw it coming. Grimson and the rest of the ranges gave their life so that the mages could run away. Half of them went down in the first assault since they had no experience with any violence or wars. They fled to safety. However, they were forced northward rather than towards the royal city. The norther siege begun and they were stuck behind enemy lines, though no-one knew about them. One of the mages, the librarian, was Melhorn.


As the war intensified and the siege kept up, Abi and the remaining mages (5 of them) lived off the land thanks to Abi's ranger training and survival skills. Two winters passed. But they were not simply surviving. Abi begun to train the five mages in the tactics and violence of war. They became the first battle mages. As the mages learned skill with the blade, Abi learned and honed her skill in magic to be effective at war. Melhorn especially took her in as a pupil, teaching her magic.


The group planned and executed a plan to break through the siege and carry on towards the city. It worked beautifully. No-one from the party was even injured and the siege line broke from the sudden assault.  Upon reaching the other side of the line, the party quickly became known as "The Company of 6". They were instrumental in breaking the siege and forcing the shapeshifters into negotiations and a truce.


The company was put in charge of creating an entire division of battle mages. However, the skill and time required for training baffled the royal court. Each battle mage has to be taught individually with a battle mage master for many years. Winter, the north, and survival had honed the company's abilities like nothing else could; training took longer during times of peace.


The royal court dismissed the company's council and started training groups of battle mages. Accepting defeat, the company started teaching batches of student in a school setting.


The school was the first target for the Elf-Shapeshifter alliance. Humans were the only species capable of being battle mages. Elven magic runs through nature and life not death, and shapeshifter magic is bound to animal forms. Only humans can attain master over elements and the world. The bloody war lasted 10 years. Abi and Melhorn, the only surviving battle mages (even students), fought thought it all. In the end, it was this fact, thet only 2 battle mages remained, that stopped the war. Human agreed to never train more battle mages and the elves and shapeshifters agreed to a binding truce of peace between the three factions.


Abi and Melhorn had to leave, so they came to earth and were introduced to The Estate, which could use the help of people with their skill.

# Hooks for Olivia + Alejandro

- Shock of sudden loss of time magic near earth sends her crashing
- She catches up to alejandro and decides to help (since she's investigating the planet)
- she tries to help some of the rampage her bubble + alejandro is causing, in which case she will be able to calculate his trajectory exactly to earth from the now-disapperaed planet

# Hooks for Alejamdro

- his bubble starts disappearing so he starts yelling and olivia picks up his communications. He is out of time and so his voice can travel in strange ways.
- The black liquid stops when the renegade ruk set's off his depth charge. This causes Alejandro to be stuck, hanging from his ankle, above the silo OR below in hte water where Volkner can see him

# Hooks for Ghost Owl

- He sees the fleet of owls gathering and they tell him that they sense something but do not have the leadership (since ghost owl is now somewhat out of the spirit world). But htey bring dreams of black waters.

- He sees Olivia and feels a kinship because of time magic use.
- He sees the blakc liquid vial and notices that it is impossible to recall any knowledge for it. As if it was there before the spirit world itself.
- He feels the renegade ruk depth charge and then feels it sesonating with the blakc liquid (vial, rat, or Alejandro)
- He meets the Estate agents, who feel a certain wisdom from him, and they ask for his knowledge to help assits the world' cleverest and most intelligent human.

# Alejandro + Olivia

- may take one mental stress because of careening destruction of bubble through space
- may take one physica stress because of being pulled by ankle

- Alejandro actually thinks Volkner looks really nice, so he will think Volkner can seduce any other human :)

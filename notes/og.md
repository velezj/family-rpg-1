# Description

Og is a true democratic Theocracy. The know that their old "gods" are massive sentient beings and fully allow them to vote on the head of Od (called the President).

Before Olivia, Og was considered a peaceful soveirnty which values discourse, creativity, and co-existance. The destruction of Og prime has created a rift within the nation. One side still believes in peaceful co-existance as an ideal, while the other side believes in a more pragmatic "defensive" posture against other nations/empires. While Og has never been extremely wealthy, it is now a poor nation which is struggling to meet it's needs as simple as food and logistical transpoation (fuel, ships, trade with others). 

Seveal Federation planets have noticed this lack of effectiveness and have begun to inch into the Og systems. Either enlargning a black market of trying to turn the systems away from Og and into their own (not officially federaltion, but free systems). This has caused concern and battle cries from both sides of the Og citizens, which are pushing for the president to do more to maintain a single, complete, and successful Og.

There are two great-beings that each get a vote, and the rest of the Og citizens together act as a third "being's" vote for ties (which rarely happen). Considered highly religious by most of the Federation worlds, they actually are a scientifically propelled nation. Their religion is based on communicating with the great-beings by controlling one's body and mind in order to both control and read the universe's gravity fields. What most outsiders and non-academics think of as a fruitful dance enjoyment is actaully communications between the individual and group of Ogs with the great-beings.

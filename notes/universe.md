# Events the have already happened (earth reference)

- planetvore has sensed the weakening of time-magic
- planetvore started eating matter to split
- planetvore split
- young planetvore crashed onto earth
- original planetvore diffused to make time-magic

- weakening of time-magic is because of Ruk incursion
- Planetvores fight the incursion (which has technology, not magic like our universe) across time
- This planetvore is a fighter is part of the pop that attacks Ruk, creating it's twisted state of being. However, all others of his pop died during assault.
  The un-split pod members and the Ruk technology incursion cause hte weakning of the time-magic, forcing this planetvore to split as soon as possible. Weakened by the attack, the split is mostly successful but the new planetvore is so weak that it crashes onto earth and goes into a deep hibernation as it grows.

# Things

## The "black liquid" <unknown by universe>

The black liquid is actually a sort of "skin" that covers the planetvores. It shields them from time-rifts and stabilizes them as the jump over space-time.

Properties:
- Stabilizes space-time travel
- Defends against space-time rifts (such as those when a planetvore eats a planet in the pasts :P )
- Wants to "heal" itself and tries to join with the rest of liquid on planetwores skin. Will try to return to largest concentration of same liquid
- Each palnetvore has subtly distinct liquid (as skin)
- Causes out-of-time "freeze" when humans touch it
- Sometimes "scratched" off when eating planets near rifts


## Planetvores

Very little is known about these creatures. They are assumed "alive" because the move. They travel though true space-time and are very hard to encounter without time magic or synthesized dimensions parrallel to their travel. 

<unknown by players/universe>
Planetvores are the source and keepers of time magic in the universe.
When a planetvore senses that time magic is weakening, it instinctually starts to feed in order to procreate. Once enough matter is devoured, a part of the planetvore separates from the original and become a brand new planetvore. The original planetvore then diffused into the space-time and time magic. New planetvores do not contain the black-liquid skin when born as must build it up by gathering the time magic around it until a skin forms.


## The Federation Council

This is a galactic group of societies that coordinate most interplanitary laws and comflicts. Somewhat like the UN and WHO combined. Most planets belong to the Council and have a representative. Each planet may send *one* representative. The Council self-selects leaders but mainly consists of smaller divisions that handle scoped problems and issues. In particular, the only memebers of the Council are from this universe, so Ruk is *not* part of it.


### Magic Division

The division that deals with widespread magic entanglements, rules governing magic safety and galactic-scale magic events.

### Division of Derrivative Execution

This division handles most logistic and treasury requests. Also handles the minutia of getting communications across teh span of the galaxy. Includes the galactic post / freight service management.

### Other Division

A secretive division. Mainly deals with strange things. Does know about Ruk incursion. 


## The Estate

Agency handling all thing recursion related, including Ruk. Secretive.

## The Ruk

### Renegade 

Trying to destroy earth because they think it will "release" ruk form earth's hold

### Free-Space Commision

Looking into Ruk's destruction / world (from Ruks' side).

# The Spirit World

The spirit waorld was created millions of years ago and did not exist when earth began forming. It is in fact a "scab" that sorrounds earth. A buffer that is mostly magical energy meant to defend earth from the planetvore child. It is the direct reaction of earth to the impact and intriccion of the planetvore gathering time magic from the earth to itself. 

The spirit world is ruled over by the "Great Spirits" who were the first defenders and helped create and shape the barrier (the spirit world). They cultivate warriors for future defense and also actively fight to keep the planetvore from stealing all time magic. The spririt world is the only place on earth left with time magic, and most magic.

The spirit world, being solely of earth, does not protect against recursion since they stand outside our universe completely aand are too far removed from earth. It also did not exists in the Predation time and hence cannot comprehend the renegade ruk, predation agent, and portal.

# Time travel and Magic

Very few mages have attunement for grand time manipultaion, but most low-level accolytes become goverment workes that can "project" a person's body trhough time and space. This projection can feel and interact but cannot substantially change events. Thesemages are like taxi drivers or travel agents.

A few mages are able to actually move objects through space and time. Olivia is one such at the top of skill. The Division of Magic also employs these rare mages. The Federation Council military divisions also have these mages as logistics experts.

# Technolgy/Science and Magic

Science and Technology use the rules of physics to get things done.
Magic bends the rules of physics to get things done.
They can and do work side-by-side in this universe.

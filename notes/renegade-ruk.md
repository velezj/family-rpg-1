# General characteristics

An eccentric Ruk that does not follow The Collective. He has a theory that the Meteor strike is somehow related to the damage of Ruk and thinks preventing it will help Ruk. This is the first time in the field (he was a theoretical academic) and so makes a few mistakes (like forgetting to decontaminate going through portals and therefore bringing alien plants to earth)

- Olivia is a *CLONE* hence the missing 50 hears and hence she is so young. Sucras Fre determines this as he struggles to rectify PID data and Olivia herself.

- Party finds Ruk hideout

- Og, Federation, The Estate, and The Tribe (mark chan)  question Imi (ruk). Imi tells them about the rip in space-time (caused by olivia's trip -- unsude if original of clone) and how Ruk are investigating the meteor. Imi wnats to stop K-T event, so mamals don't become dominant (so nomore humans :) ).

- Young planetvore recounts the events of Ruk incursion, planetvore defense, hurt parent and resulting crash and wound.

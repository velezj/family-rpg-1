# Black liquid

- vial of black liquid provided to Volkner by Estate agents is actually from a *different* planetvore (part of the pod) that is not longer in existence hence it is *inert*.

- black liquid on frozen men was dredged up is a "steam" vent hence it actually a cloud of particulates. It does belong to the young planetvore.

- black liquid on Alajandro also belongs to young planetvore (or it's original parent, they share the liquid).
